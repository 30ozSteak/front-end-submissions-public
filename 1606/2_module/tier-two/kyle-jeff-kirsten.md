## Networking
# Instructor: Brenna & Bree  
# Student: Jeff, Kirsten, Kyle
# Notes:
  - Networking app that holds contact information. User can filter by "follow up". Initially designed for mobile. Gravatar is pulled in from email you use to create account.

  - Need to follow up on testing expectations with firebase and eslint numbers

## Specification Adherence

3 - No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.

## Risk Taking and Creativity

3 - The project shows that the developers carefully considered their approach and were able to implement concepts taught over the last two weeks. The application shows evidence that developers dug deep into documentation for the technologies they used and experimented with different approaches.

## Design
3 - The application has a strong approach to layout and content hierarchy, but typography and color choices are lacking. The evaluator has several recommended changes to improvement.


## User Interface
4 - The application is pleasant, logical, and easy to use. The application is fully responsive, and has clearly had special consideration around usability on devices. There are no holes in functionality and the application stands on its own to be used by the instructor without guidance from the developer.

## HTML Style

3: Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing.


## CSS/Sass Style

3: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS/Sass is doing.


## JavaScript Style

3- Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

## Testing

4 - Project has a running test suite that exercises the application at multiple levels (feature and unit). The test suite covers almost all aspects of the application. The testing in this project shows that the students dedicated themselves to overcoming obstacles and figure out how to test parts of the application that were otherwise “hard to test.”
3 - Project has a running test suite that tests and multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All functionality is covered by tests. The application has robust unit tests and makes some use of feature testing where appropriate and applicable.

## Workflow

4 - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

## Code Sanitation

The output from a code sanitizer (either JSHint or ESLint) shows…

4 - Zero complaints
3 - Five or fewer complaints
2 - Six to ten complaints
1 - More than ten complaints
