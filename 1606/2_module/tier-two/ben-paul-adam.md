## Tier Two
# Instructor: Bree  
# Student: Ben, Paul, Adam
# notes:
- pumped the group took risks
- production was buggy


## Specification Adherence (TBD)

2 - The application is in a usable state, but is missing 1 or more of the features outline in the specification above.


## Risk Taking and Creativity (TBD)

3.5 - The project shows that the developers carefully considered their approach and were able to implement concepts taught over the last two weeks. The application shows evidence that developers dug deep into documentation for the technologies they used and experimented with different approaches.


## Design
3 - The application has a strong approach to layout and content hierarchy, but typography and color choices are lacking. The evaluator has several recommended changes to improvement.

## User Interface
3 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality.

## HTML Style

3: Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing.

## CSS/Sass Style

3: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS/Sass is doing.

## JavaScript Style

3- Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.


## Testing

3 - Project has a running test suite that tests and multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All functionality is covered by tests. The application has robust unit tests and makes some use of feature testing where appropriate and applicable.

## Workflow

4 - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.


## Code Sanitation

The output from a code sanitizer (either JSHint or ESLint) showsâ€¦

4 - Zero complaints
