## Tier-two
# Instructor: Jhun, Brenna (Design)
# Student: Brett Hevia, Peter Springer, Casey Metz, Kris Foss.
# Notes:

- spec adherence was kind of soft but they delivered a working application! (i'd use it)
- tests checked for existence and thats about it.
- pumped group took risks

Design
- Enjoyed the design choices for landing page, team worked hard to write mobile-friendly markup. Good use of limited fancy-styles ($ amount) and streamline white font. Color scheme on landing page is well thought out. Criticisms fall only on index page where the box size hinders user's view of past purchases. Also red color button is out of place. Would like to see a simplified/easier to view display box (roped into UI score).

- User interface could use some clarification. Does it take dollars with or without decimal? When it says "date" can I say "today" or do I need to put in numbers and in what order?

## Specification Adherence

3 - No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.

## Risk Taking and Creativity

3.5 - The project shows that the developers carefully considered their approach and were able to implement concepts taught over the last two weeks. The application shows evidence that developers dug deep into documentation for the technologies they used and experimented with different approaches.

## Design

4 - The application is visually appealing and shows thoughtful and effective use of typography, color, and layout. The application looks professional, with visuals enhancing the user’s experience. The evaluator has very few recommended changes.

## User Interface

3 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality.

## HTML Style

4: Developer is able to craft HTML that is semantically correct and clearly organized. There are zero instances where an instructor would recommend taking a different approach. Developer writes markup that is exceptionally clear and well-factored. Application is expertly organized and logically structured with with thoughtful use of tags and selectors.

## CSS/Sass Style

4: Application has exceptionally well-factored CSS/Sass with little or no duplication and all styles separated out into logical stylesheets. There are zero instances where an instructor would recommend taking a different approach.

## JavaScript Style

3- Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

## Testing

3 - Project has a running test suite that tests and multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All functionality is covered by tests. The application has robust unit tests and makes some use of feature testing where appropriate and applicable.

## Workflow

4 - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

## Code Sanitation

The output from a code sanitizer (either JSHint or ESLint) shows…

4 - Zero complaints
