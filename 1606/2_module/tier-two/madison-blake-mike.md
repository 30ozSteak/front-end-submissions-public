# notes:

Really lovely design and great product idea, needed more time to really finish the UI and make a polished MVP.

## Specification Adherence

3 - No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.

## Risk Taking and Creativity

3 - The project shows that the developers carefully considered their approach and were able to implement concepts taught over the last two weeks. The application shows evidence that developers dug deep into documentation for the technologies they used and experimented with different approaches.

## Design

3 - The application has a strong approach to layout and content hierarchy, but typography and color choices are lacking. The evaluator has several recommended changes to improvement.

## User Interface

2.5 - feels very in-process, if it gets tightened up by monday will adjust score.

<!-- 3 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality.
2 - The application shows effort in the interface, but the result is not effective. The evaluator has some difficulty using the application when reviewing the features in the user stories. -->

## HTML Style

4: Developer is able to craft HTML that is semantically correct and clearly organized. There are zero instances where an instructor would recommend taking a different approach. Developer writes markup that is exceptionally clear and well-factored. Application is expertly organized and logically structured with with thoughtful use of tags and selectors.

## CSS/Sass Style

3: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS/Sass is doing.


## JavaScript Style

2 - Your application has some duplication and minor bugs. Developer can speak to most choices made in the code and knows what every line is doing.

## Testing

2.5 - Project has sporadic use of tests at multiple levels. The application contains numerous holes in testing and/or many features are untested.

## Workflow

3.5 - The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.

## Code Sanitation

The output from a code sanitizer (either JSHint or ESLint) showsâ€¦

4 - Zero complaints
