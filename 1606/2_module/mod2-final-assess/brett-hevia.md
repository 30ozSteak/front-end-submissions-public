Final Evaluation: Scrabble
Student: Brett
Instructor: Brenna
Notes: Solid! Zero hesitation diving into react syntax both constructing components and mapping functions to props and/or state of nested components.

Hesitation on implementing a map function to iterate over an array living in state - but given more time would be fine.

Seems very comfortable with concepts and could run with any redirection immediately.
