Notes:

Rubric
Specification Adherence

    3 - The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by React. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.

Component Architecture

    4 - Application is broken out into small reusable React components. Complicated functionality is wrapped in parent components. There are zero cases where a complicated component can be broken down into smaller composite components.

User Interface

    3 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality.

CSS/Sass Style

    3 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS/Sass is doing.

JavaScript Style


    3- Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

Testing
    Notes: 16 Passing

    2.5 - Valiant effort to implement Enzyme testing, would like to see more functionality tested besides the component being mounted/appearing in the DOM. No unit tests.

    3 - Project has a running test suite that tests and multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All functionality is covered by tests. The application makes some use of feature testing.
    2 - Project has sporadic use of tests and multiple levels. The application contains numerous holes in testing and/or many features are untested.

Workflow

    4 - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.
    3 - The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.
    2 - The developer makes large commits covering multiple features that make it difficult for the evaluator to determine the evolution of the application.
    1 - The developer committed the code to version control in only a few commits. The evaluator cannot determine the evolution of the application.
    0 - The application was not checked into version control.

Code Sanitation

The output from a code sanitizer (either JSHint or ESLint) shows…

    3 - Five or fewer complaints

Design

    4 - The application is visually appealing and shows thoughtful and effective use of typography, color, and layout. The application looks professional, with visuals enhancing the user’s experience. The evaluator has very few recommended changes.
