Specification Adherence

    3 - The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by React. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.

Component Architecture

    4 - Application is broken out into small reusable React components. Complicated functionality is wrapped in parent components. There are zero cases where a complicated component can be broken down into smaller composite components.
    3 - Application is broken in out into at least 8 components that properly encapsulate functionality. There is no more than one component that could be broken down into composite parts.

User Interface

    4 - The application is pleasant, logical, and easy to use. The application is fully responsive, and has clearly had special consideration around usability on devices. There no holes in functionality and the application stands on it own to be used by the instructor without guidance from the developer.

CSS/Sass Style

    3 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS/Sass is doing.

JavaScript Style

    4 - Application has exceptionally well-factored code with little or no duplication and all components separated out into logical components. There zero instances where an instructor would recommend taking a different approach.

Testing

    2.5 - Significant effort to implement enzyme testing with zero unit tests

    3 - Project has a running test suite that tests and multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All functionality is covered by tests. The application makes some use of feature testing.
    2 - Project has sporadic use of tests and multiple levels. The application contains numerous holes in testing and/or many features are untested.

Workflow
