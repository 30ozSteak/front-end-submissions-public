Group:  Jeff & Andy

Brenna's Notes:
  Really great use of modular functions and breaking out functionality into tiny components. Opportunities to refactor large files, but arguments against why they chose not to speak to design decisions.

  Missing the visual cue for when the timer is almost up, but will refactor and finish by end of day for a 4.

  Strong implementation of TDD and attempts at integration testing. 

## Specification Adherence
<!-- will bump up if visual cue added by end of the day -->
<!-- 4 - The application meets all of the requirements listed above and implements one or more of the extensions. -->
3 - The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by jQuery. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.


## User Interface  

3 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality.

## HTML Style

4: Developer is able to craft HTML that is semantically correct and clearly organized. There are zero instances where an instructor would recommend taking a different approach. Developer writes markup that is exceptionally clear and well-factored. Application is expertly organized and logically structured with with a clear, thoughtful use of tags and selectors.

## CSS/Sass Style

3: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS/Sass is doing.


## JavaScript Style

4 - Application has exceptionally well-factored code with little or no duplication and all components separated out into logical components. There zero instances where an instructor would recommend taking a different approach.

## Testing

4 - Project has a running test suite that exercises the application at multiple levels (feature and unit). The test suite covers almost all aspects of the application.

## Workflow

4 - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

## Code Sanitation

The output from a code sanitizer (either JSHint or ESLint) showsâ€¦
4 - Zero complaints

## Design

3 - The application has a strong approach to layout and content hierarchy, but typography and color choices are lacking. The evaluator has several recommended changes to improvement.
