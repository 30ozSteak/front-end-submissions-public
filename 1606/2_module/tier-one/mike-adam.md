# Specification Adherence

4 - The application meets all of the requirements listed above and implements one or more of the extensions.

# User Interface

4 - The application is pleasant, logical, and easy to use. The application is fully responsive, and has clearly had special consideration around usability on devices. There no holes in functionality and the application stands on it own to be used by the instructor without guidance from the developer.

Note: the task and break time inputs gets too small on mobile, not unusable, but needs some adjustment.

# HTML Style

2.75 - a little overly enthusiastic with adding wrapping elements, made it difficult to read, and likely difficult to incorporate layout adjustments down the road/ would be tricky to maintain.

3: Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing.
2: Developer writes effective HTML, but does not write semantically correct and clearly organized code. Application shows some effort to use semantically correct HTML, but the divisions are inconsistent or unclear. There are many un-semantic tags and unnecessary selectors and it is not clear to the evaluator what a given section of code represents visually. Developer cannot speak to every line of code.

# CSS/Sass Style

3: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS/Sass is doing.

# JavaScript Style

3- Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

# Testing

3 - Project has a running test suite that tests and multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All functionality is covered by tests. The application makes some use of feature testing.


# Workflow

4 - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.


# Code Sanitation

The output from a code sanitizer (either JSHint or ESLint) shows…

4 - Zero complaints

# Design

3.5 - just needs little tightening up, rethink color choices for the break count down

<!-- 4 - The application is visually appealing and shows thoughtful and effective use of typography, color, and layout. The application looks professional, with visuals enhancing the user’s experience. The evaluator has very few recommended changes.
3 - The application has a strong approach to layout and content hierarchy, but typography and color choices are lacking. The evaluator has several recommended changes to improvement. -->
