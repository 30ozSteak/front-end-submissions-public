## Completion

#### Were you able to complete the base functionality?

We did not complete sorting by number of link clicks, or sorting by date added. We also did not get to showing the date the link was created. (I don't even want to talk about the awful box-shadow on hover; it fell lower and lower on the priority list as time wore on.)

This was mostly due to a lack of time (as was the messy code). The demo competition on Thursday night, though great, severely cut into our project work time. It was also due to the plain old fact that we didn't check in on the spec details once we got into the feverish frenzy of racing the clock; that's totally on us.

#### Which extensions, if any, did you complete?
None, as far as we can tell.

# Code Quality

#### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you are proud of
[happy code](https://github.com/JohnBinning/jetFuel/blob/master/public/scripts/index.js#L93-L98)

* Why were you proud of this piece of code?

#### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you feel not great about
[sad code](https://github.com/JohnBinning/jetFuel/blob/master/public/scripts/index.js#L63-L71)

* Why do you feel not awesome about the code? What challenges did you face trying to write/refactor it?
```window.location``` is disgusting and I am ashamed. We literally wrestled with the redirect functionality of the app for over 8 hours (including taking the time to ask for help). Along the way I got things partly working (the app did not redirect but the generated short url, when manually copied into the browser, successfully redirected), but when I used an anchor tag, everything stopped working and it took another hour to untangle it.

Ultimately there's a LOT of DRYing up and refactoring we'd like to do.

#### Attach a screenshot or paste the output from your terminal of the result of your test-suite running.

Looking forward to cleaning this up for our portfolios!
