[Vanilla construction](https://github.com/Adamj1232/Jet-Fuel/blob/master/public/links.js)

* Why were you proud of this piece of code?
Proud might not be the right word. More in awe of how people ever built intricate websites with pure vanilla JS, and grateful we don't have to do that.

[The whole server](https://github.com/Adamj1232/Jet-Fuel/blob/master/server.js)

* Why do you feel not awesome about the code? What challenges did you face trying to write/refactor it?
Nothing that experience and time won't fix.  It's still new, and feel like it can be done better.
