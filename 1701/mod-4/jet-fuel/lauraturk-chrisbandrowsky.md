At the current state, base functionality is complete. A user can log on to the website, create a folder, take a url, and shorten it.

* Why were you proud of this piece of code?

We found that making migrations and adding data to a database was a lot of fun. It was enjoyable to get it to work. 

#### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you feel not great about
[sad code](https://github.com/lauraturk/jet_fuel/blob/master/server.js#L127-L163)

* Why do you feel not awesome about the code? What challenges did you face trying to write/refactor it?

In the last few minutes, as we pushed to production, we ran into a serious bug trying to implement a suggestion from Brittany that disabled us from redirecting our links. It worked. And then it didn't. After struggling with it for a good while, we've fixed the bug, but lost valuable time on doing additional tests to our suite. 
#### Attach a screenshot or paste the output from your terminal of the result of your test-suite running.

#### Please feel free to ask any other questions or make any other statements below!

We felt the time crunch was awful on this project. We got a lot done, but it feels like there is a lot more to go. Morale is low. 

Chris did a great job doing a lot of last minute heavy lifting as I was busy/preoccupied with demo night. Shout out to Chris!

Laura killed it with the UI reformatting and refactoring the ridiculousness that was Chris's jQuery (it wasn't that bad, Chris just doesn't like jQuery. She also crushed the popularity sort.
