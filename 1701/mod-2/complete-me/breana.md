# Comments:

### 1. Fundamental JavaScript & Style
// use this.find in your select function --> 3
* 2.5:  Application runs but the code has long methods, unnecessary or poorly named variables, and needs significant refactoring


### 2. Test-Driven Development
* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality


### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

### 4. Functional Expectations

* 3: Application meets all requirements as laid out per the specification.

### 5. Code Sanitation

The output from ESLint showsâ€¦

* 4 - Zero complaints
