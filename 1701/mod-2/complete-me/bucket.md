### 1. Fundamental JavaScript & Style

* 3:  Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring


### 2. Test-Driven Development
// add tests to make sure nodes are being created (i.e. children of trie)
// need a test for select --> 3
* 2.5: Application makes some use of tests, but the coverage is insufficient

### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

### 4. Functional Expectations
// implement select --> 3
// move dictionary to test
* 2: Application runs, but does not work properly, or does not meet specifications.

### 5. Code Sanitation
