#### Project Pitch  
An App that condenses the most popular news articles from over 70 different sources. Users can make comments, save it, upvote/downvote articles/news sources, and score it on a variety of factors like if it leaned towards being conservative or liberal or trustworthy or untrustworthy. News sources can be judged later in search criteria by these factors and by popularity/controversial/most talked about
### Deliverables

5.) stats shown on card
6.) Setup React Router
7.) User Sign-in/log-in/log-out
8.) Setup Articles to be saved
9.) setup comment section
10.) visual effects of stats on card


### MVP
