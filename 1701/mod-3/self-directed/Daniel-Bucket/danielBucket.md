#### Check In: 1  

#### Collaborators:  
Are you working with anyone else?

#### Project Pitch  
Now that you've had a few more days to dig into your project ideas, summarize your newly finalized plan.

A route planning app for trail users that will allow the user to identify his/her proposed distance, expected completion time and elevation gain all based on the user plotted route.

### Deliverables  

#### Stack:
  React-Redux
  GoogleMaps
  FireBase

#### APIs:  
Links to any API docs that you have decided to use
[GoogleMaps JavaScript](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/?authuser=1)

#### Wireframes  
Include screenshots to wireframes or comps of **EVERY PAGE** of the MVP of your app. You can include these by adding additional files to your submissions directory, or linking to an imgur account. You're asked to use Sketch, or Balsamiq, or a different digital wireframe/comp application but if you choose to use pen/paper please let your instructors know and bring those to class Monday.

Link to your waffle.io account with at least 10 cards indicating baby steps to how you want to structure your attack.

### Reflection  

#### Order Of Attack  
Based on your wireframes, in what order are you going to approach building out this application?

  I'll start with just trying to get successful API call for data pertaining to geolocation, elevation, distance and map drawing.
  Then it's on to composing a React/Redux architecture.

#### MVP
  When the user has logged in and plotted a path, data should be presented that displays that particular path's distance, estimated time to completion, max elevation and elevation gain.

#### Nice To Haves   
What are your reach features? Ie: "Web Sockets & 3D Animations!"
  Saved user data for individual and social use allowing for functionality like heat maps for trail traffic.

#### Biggest Challenges  
What do you foresee being the biggest challenges of this project? List at least 3 resources you've thought of to help overcome these challenges.
  Catching up on the last three weeks of class. Knowing when and how to fetch data. And implementing a backend server.
