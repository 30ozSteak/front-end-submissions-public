### Student:

Travis Gregory

### Project Name:  

HobbyTube

#### Check In: 1  

#### Collaborators:  

I'll likely be reaching out to my mentors for some feedback assuming they have the time.

#### Project Pitch  

As a woodworker I frequently find myself stumped on what to do next or how to perform a certain process. In these moments I rely on sites like Pinterest and YouTube to give me tutorials so that I can learn the skill needed. Unfortunately Pinterest comes with a lot of other content I don't want and YouTube does as well. My app makes it so you can search for things you are interested in and create Projects that contain all of your favorite tutorial videos from YouTube without the noise of YouTube.

### Deliverables  

#### Stack:

- React
- Redux
- Router
- Enzyme

### Reflection  

#### Order Of Attack  

- I'll start by getting React, Redux, and Router set up.
- Then I'll outline my components and begin building those.
- Next I'll set up my API call, figure out the data I'll need from that and make a mock file to use in development.
- Once that is set up I'll write a few test to get things started.
- From testing I'll continue to refine my components.

#### MVP

My MVP will allow the user to search the YouTube API, create a project, and add videos to the project for later viewing.

#### Nice To Haves   

I'd like to have a page where the user can just type in a search and have the result stream continuously as if it were a tv channel based on their interests.

#### Biggest Challenges  
I can see OAuth being an issue since I've never used it.
