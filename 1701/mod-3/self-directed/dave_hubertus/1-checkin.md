Solo

#### Project Pitch  
Now that you've had a few more days to dig into your project ideas, summarize your newly finalized plan.

Purpose of project is to learn how to incorporate google maps or leaflet into a react built application. I would like to be able to receive lat/long coordinates from an api and render locations on a map.

### Deliverables  

#### Stack:
GoogleMaps API <br />
UFO API<br />
React<br />
Router <-- If I make it to my nice to haves<br />
Maybe Backend??? <-- API call error mentioning coors <-- postman returns the correct json object

#### APIs:  
Links to any API docs that you have decided to use

https://ufo-api.herokuapp.com/api#home <br />
https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/tutorial

#### Wireframes  
Include screenshots to wireframes or comps of **EVERY PAGE** of the MVP of your app. You can include these by adding additional files to your submissions directory, or linking to an imgur account. You're asked to use Sketch, or Balsamiq, or a different digital wireframe/comp application but if you choose to use pen/paper please let your instructors know and bring those to class Monday.  

#### Github Issues
Link to your github account with at least 10 issues indicating baby steps to how you want to structure your attack.

### Reflection  

#### Order Of Attack  
Based on your wireframes, in what order are you going to approach building out this application?

MAP --> practice PINS --> api call/backend --> api cleaner --> true PINS --> Year/month filter buttons/slider --> testing --> additional data visualization



#### MVP

A functioning map that renders ufo sighting claims from api. User should have ability to search for all sightings to a near by area. Map should have ability to filter sightings by year/month.

#### Nice To Haves   
What are your reach features? Ie: "Web Sockets & 3D Animations!"

Different pages that have different forms of data visualization maybe some chart.js <br />
Different map layers such as heat maps.

#### Biggest Challenges  
What do you forsee being the biggest challenges of this project? List at least 3 resources you've thought of to help overcome these challenges.

Learning how to manipulate the google maps tile and displaying pins based on data from an api. <br />
Building a backend if it is needed.
