### Student: Zane Russell

### Project Name: On Tour

#### Check In: 1  

#### Collaborators:  
Flying solo

#### Project Pitch  
After tour locations are entered, On Tour will query Google Maps for distance and locations, as well as average gasoline price for the state, and utilizing a user provided MPG for the tour vehicle, will calculate a gasoline cost for the tour. Musicians will also be able to include information about the venue and personal notes, and print a travel itinerary.

### Deliverables  

#### Stack:
On Tour will use React, React-Router, and Redux, in preperation for integration into a larger project.

#### APIs:  
Google Maps API
JamBase API
Department of Energy API
Scour GasBuddy.com for gas prices

#### Wireframes  
Included in attached PDF

#### Waffle.io
[Waffle Tour](https://waffle.io/zanedr/OnTour)

### Reflection  

#### Order Of Attack  
Google API first, DOI second, build out components and loose design, integrate jambase query, scour gas prices, ???, profit

#### MVP

#### Nice To Haves   
Animated menus, ability to save tour dates that will persist

#### Biggest Challenges  
Coordinating all the data and making dynamic API calls

## Instructor Notes

- Getting the Google API connected and running
