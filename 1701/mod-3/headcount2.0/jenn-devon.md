## Students: Jenn & Devon
## Evaluator: Taylor
## Notes:

Always ask the question, do you need state inside this component?
 - Duplicating code will hurt. Try to have state just in one spot.
Need to fix responsiveness.
Tests need to have more meat, aka more mounting tests and testing the correct things.
Refactor tractor needs to happen.


## Specification Adherence
- 3 - The application completes 5 iterations.

## Code Quality
- 3 - Developer appears comfortable in React demonstrated gaps in knowledge of how the tools should be used and/or the app contains unrefactored code.

## PropType Implementation
- Fail - There are components missing proptype validation.

## CSS/Design
- 2.5 - Developer has made intentional design decisions to create a user friendly application but Louisa would be mad.
