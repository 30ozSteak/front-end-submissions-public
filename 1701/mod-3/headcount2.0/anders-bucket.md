## Notes: 

Team felt that project went well. Worked up to the deadline but steady the entire time.

Extremely clean interface, really great work there!

Need to use lifecycle methods / passing callbacks - setting global variables in app instead of using state updating correctly. Look into batch updating state and passing callbacks.

In tests, mock functions not being used successfully yet - make sure to spend some time on wrapping your head around this problem.

Recommendation for Rest of the Morning:

- Getting mock jest function test passing
- Try to remove global variables in the App component but using callbacks to setting state or different lifecycle methods

## Specification Adherence

- 3 - The application completes 5 iterations.

## Code Quality

- 3 - Developer appears comfortable in React demonstrated gaps in knowledge of how the tools should be used and/or the app contains unrefactored code.

## PropType Implementation

- Pass - Proptype validation is implemented for any component receiving props.

## CSS/Design

- 4 - Developer has made a targeted effort to make the app appealing and user friendly. Evaluator has minimal recommendations for design changes.

## Testing

- 3.5 - Almost all components are tested to a level that indicates developer has an understanding of testing
