## Notes:

Fix functionality for iteration 5.
Legend to understand data.
Did you need both search state & district state?
Question to always ask yourself is do I need State here.
Grades will change for propTypes fixed, iteration 5 done, CSS Legend.

## Specification Adherence
- 2 - The application is in a usable state, but is missing 1 of the features outlined in the specification above.

## Code Quality
- 3 - Developer appears comfortable in React demonstrated gaps in knowledge of how the tools should be used and/or the app contains unrefactored code.

## PropType Implementation
- Pass - Proptype validation is implemented for any component receiving props.
  - Missing one PropTypes on CompareCard

## CSS/Design
- 2.5 - Developer has made intentional design decisions to create a user friendly application but Louisa would be mad.

## Testing
- 2.5 - A valid attempt was made to test functionality with obvious gaps where functionality is not tested
