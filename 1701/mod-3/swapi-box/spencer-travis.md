Students: Travis, Spencer

Instructor: Jhun, Taylor, Meeka

Notes: 

Recommendation that when you get back from the weekend, merge your branches and document every bug and every thing that you would want to fix. Not to actually fix, but to be able to revisit this project when you want to refactor something or refresh on it.

Recommendation to do api calls in the componentDidMount instead of WillMount.

Watch your naming for functions like `onClick` - this means something else in React world - and also it isn't very clear to the next developer in the code.

Looking at your stubs, you're in mod 3 how - you can refactor those better - Jhun
