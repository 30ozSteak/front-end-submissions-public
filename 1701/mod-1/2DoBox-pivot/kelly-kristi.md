## Instructor Evaluation Points

### Specification Adherence

3 - The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by jQuery. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from phases 1 through 4 that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.

### User Interface

4 - The application is pleasant, logical, and easy to use. The application is fully responsive, and has clearly had special consideration around usability on devices. There no holes in functionality and the application stands on it own to be used by the instructor without guidance from the developer.

### HTML Style

3.5 - Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing.

### JavaScript Style

3 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

### Testing

3 - Project has a running test suite but fails to cover some features. The application makes some use of feature testing.

### Workflow

3 - The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.
