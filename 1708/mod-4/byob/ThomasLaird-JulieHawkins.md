# Code Quality

#### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub that you are proud of
Thomas - [happy code](https://github.com/t-laird/ufo-tracker/blob/f6fd0ae41ff1ba734a11c1295c379587449ba30a/db/seeds/dev/ufo-data.js#L16-L49)

Julie - [happy code](https://github.com/t-laird/ufo-tracker/blob/f6fd0ae41ff1ba734a11c1295c379587449ba30a/test/routes.spec.js#L114-L133)


* Why were you proud of this piece of code?

Thomas - We needed two relations given our 3 tables so we had to use two helpers to get our Location and Shape IDs. Since both of these functions were asynchronous we had to come up with a creative solution to return the data appropriately. Our solution - using a nested series of promises that are all wrapped in a Promise.all, while not the cleanest, solves this complex problem effectively and preserves the integrity of the informating being seeded in.

Julie - Using .every here allowed us to avoid testing all of the objects returned in the response individually and makes this test cover the server response more fully.

#### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub that you feel not great about
[sad code](https://github.com/t-laird/ufo-tracker/blob/dd6d8343c2eae3fa0425009daa2b8f53b11e1885/server.js#L97-L105)

* Why do you feel not awesome about the code? What challenges did you face trying to write/refactor it?

We would have liked to refactor this code and the other helper function into one function that could be reused in all cases where a helper is necessary.
