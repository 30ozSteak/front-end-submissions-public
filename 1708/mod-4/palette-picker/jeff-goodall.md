## Completion

#### Were you able to complete the base functionality?

If not, explain what is missing and why.

Yes, however I didnt clean it up as much as I would like. For example the delete buttons in the project section on the palletes do not work correctly. only the delete button on the project works right. purhaps I will remove those buttons but I was sooooooo close at geting them working.

#### Which extensions, if any, did you complete?
none, no extensions were completed.

# Code Quality

#### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub that you are proud of
[happy code](https://github.com/goodalls/palette-picker/blob/77c228fb4b2aaa0b095fe9597e7cd813c31a5fea/public/js/script.js#L1)
* Why were you proud of this piece of code?
I am happy with this code because I spent alot of time trying to figure out the random color generator and getting the colors to work in jQuery. I even at one point made a recursive color generator function that didn't make it into production but was a pretty cool bit of code. jQuery has way more features then I imagined in mod1 (last time I used it)

I would like to point out my testing and server file also I feel that they are pretty amazing!!!

#### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub that you feel not great about
[sad code](https://github.com/goodalls/palette-picker/blob/77c228fb4b2aaa0b095fe9597e7cd813c31a5fea/public/js/script.js#L103)

UGLY - well I put it together in the last minutes of the project and made something work. but it wasn't what I intended for sure.
* Why do you feel not awesome about the code? What challenges did you face trying to write/refactor it?

#### Attach a screenshot or paste the output from your terminal of the result of your test-suite running.

#### Link to Design Inspiration

* Show us what you used as design inspiration (another color picker site, a dribbble UI element, a user flow, etc.) and explain what you stole from it

OOPPPPSSSS my design is significantly lacking because I spent so much time on the server and database.
