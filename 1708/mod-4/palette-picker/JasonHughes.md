## Completion

#### Were you able to complete the base functionality?
No

If not, explain what is missing and why.
I got hung up on getting my post to work correctly. It was difficult trying to manage project ID's, then the palettes that would go into a particular project. 

#### Which extensions, if any, did you complete?

# Code Quality

#### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub that you are proud of
[happy code](https://github.com/jasonhughes1/Palette-Picker/blob/master/public/js/scripts.js#L27-L31)
I liked how this function was much longer when I first started the project and was able to refactor it to being much more concise!
* Why were you proud of this piece of code?

#### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub that you feel not great about
[sad code](https://github.com/jasonhughes1/Palette-Picker/blob/master/public/js/scripts.js#L97-L115)

* Why do you feel not awesome about the code? What challenges did you face trying to write/refactor it?
This is quite a large function, and I have another append function in my js file. I feel as though I can add them together/shorten them.
#### Attach a screenshot or paste the output from your terminal of the result of your test-suite running.
Test environment currently setup, but no tests to run. Will be adding them this weekend.

#### Link to Design Inspiration

* Show us what you used as design inspiration (https://unsplash.com/search/photos/grey) and explain what you stole from it
I wanted a background picture that wouldnt take away from my color palettes. I thought a grey background image would look great.

#### Please feel free to ask any other questions or make any other statements below!

Anything else you wanna say!

I know this is not currently a passing project. I will put the hours in this weekend and get it done.
