## Completion

#### Were you able to complete the base functionality?

Most of the base functionality is there, with the exception of project names being unique. Will need to update that on the server side and have some sort of error message display if a user attempts to add an existing project.

#### Which extensions, if any, did you complete?

None.

# Code Quality

#### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub that you are proud of
[happy code](https://github.com/Cache123/palette-picker/blob/master/public/js/scripts.js#L20-L23)

* I spoke to other students about how they toggled their classes and my solution seemed much easier and straightforward!

#### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub that you feel not great about
[sad code](https://github.com/Cache123/palette-picker/blob/master/public/js/scripts.js#L118-L136)

* Sad code since there's no validation for inputing project names.

#### Link to Design Inspiration

* Show us what you used as design inspiration (another color picker site, a dribbble UI element, a user flow, etc.) and explain what you stole from it

[dribble inspiration](https://www.wix.com/website-template/view/html/1945/?siteId=70207374-ba42-48b4-97d0-a270ec1de7b0&metaSiteId=aad5ee72-e7e2-480f-8e36-2693a67813e6&originUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wix.com%2Fwebsite%2Ftemplates%2Fhtml%2Flanding-pages)

I really appreciated how simple the front landing page was, so tried to incorporate that into my design and pushing everything out that was extra out of sight and toward the bottom. Such as creating and saving palettes and projects.

Testing is difficult and I still don't fully understand why it's breaking when I POST, but have a general idea of why.
