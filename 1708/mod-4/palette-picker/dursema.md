## Completion

#### Were you able to complete the base functionality?

Yes, but I didn't sanatize my inputs so when a user types in a project name with a special character, it break the app. My code is inefficient and sloppy. 

#### Which extensions, if any, did you complete?

None

# Code Quality

#### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub that you are proud of
[happy code](https://github.com/jdursema/PalettePicker/blob/master/server.js#L109)

* Why were you proud of this piece of code?
It was the last piece of functionality i had to write and it was very difficult because I needed the project name and palette name. 


#### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub that you feel not great about
[sad code](https://github.com/jdursema/PalettePicker/blob/master/public/js/scripts.js#L141)

* Why do you feel not awesome about the code? What challenges did you face trying to write/refactor it?
Time, I ran out of time so by the end I was just throwing code at my computer to see what works. I had a hard time getting the ids to us in fetchs.

#### Please feel free to ask any other questions or make any other statements below!

I had a really hard time with this project. I worked really hard on it, but ultimately I ran out of time. I'm hoping that the work I do over the weekend will bring it up to a reasonable standard.
