## Completion

#### Were you able to complete the base functionality?

No - The palettes and projects are being generated but are not posting together right now. The palettes also need to delete
Also tests are not written. I will finish this weekend. 

#### Which extensions, if any, did you complete?

# Code Quality

#### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub that you are proud of
[happy code](https://github.com/mariastlouis/palette-picker/blob/d55c7e2b1bc7298aac8ab3ff5581f72eb6d8a453/public/js/scripts.js#L11)

* This made a pretty circle with the color template inside

#### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub that you feel not great about
[sad code](https://github.com/mariastlouis/palette-picker/blob/d55c7e2b1bc7298aac8ab3ff5581f72eb6d8a453/public/js/scripts.js#L136)

* I'm writing too many functions to do little things

#### Attach a screenshot or paste the output from your terminal of the result of your test-suite running.

[test suite]()

No tests running

#### Link to Design Inspiration

* Show us what you used as design inspiration (another color picker site, a dribbble UI element, a user flow, etc.) and explain what you stole from it

#### Please feel free to ask any other questions or make any other statements below!

Not enough time to complete the project in time required- especially with demo night and especially since we weren't taught the basic functionality until late in the project. It feels like a punishment for going to demo night.I will finish over the weekend.
