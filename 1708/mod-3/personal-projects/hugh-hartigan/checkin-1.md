## Project Name: Our Planet

#### Check In: 1

#### Project Pitch

* An app that identifies the top most engangered species by continent, making their situation digestible to the user. A prominent goal is also to relate how each particular animal's existence is important to the world ecosystem, specifically their benefit to humans in their region and/or worldwide. Each animal will have information on their habitat, estimated population, and the aforementioned benefit to humans, as well as high-resolution photos. Credit will be given to data gained from the World Wildlife Foundation, as well as for any photos used for each animal. Links will also be provided to direct users towards charities that work toward the benefit of animal welfare.

### Deliverables

#### Stack:

* React
* Redux
* Router
* SASS

#### APIs:

* Personal Database API
* Google Maps
  * Reach goal: Watson Language Translator

#### Wireframes

* [Our Planet Wireframe](https://xd.adobe.com/view/a017c691-0ff2-4b78-979a-b5e5e64187b7)

#### Waffle & Github

* [Our Planet Waffle](https://waffle.io/HartiganHM/our-planet)
* [Our Planet GitHub Repo](https://github.com/HartiganHM/our-planet)

#### Order Of Attack

* Setup app with `create-react-app`
* Install all necessary node modules
  * Confirm testing is working
  * Confirm app is running on localhost
* Build repository on GitHub
* Build out wireframe
* Build out Iteration 0 with Waffle

#### MVP

* App displays animals with necessary info and images (of most importance is animals benefit to human life)
* Users are able to selectively view animals based on general location (ie continent)
* App links to charities
* Each animal has it's own page/component that displays its own information

#### Nice To Haves

* Each animal page will show general regional location through Google Maps API
* Global map that is interactive and displays animals by continent clicked
* Quick way to translate information to other languages (Spanish, French, German, Japanese, etc.)

#### Biggest Challenges

* Building database of necessary information (~40 animals)
* Dynamic routing to each animal information page/component
* Comprehensive UI/UX that makes information digestible, but meaningful
