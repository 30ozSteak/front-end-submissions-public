## Project Name:

Crypto Vis

#### Check In: 1

App that gives a user access to the coins they are tracking. The data will be presented with data vis that is easier to read than the most commonly used applications to date.

### Deliverables

#### Stack:

React-Native

3. Data vis rendering all coins with a growth comparison

#### MVP

User can create an account, login, track multiple coins. View graphs of at least two coins at one time. 

#### Nice To Haves

* Pull in user crypto portfolio

##### Unrealistically abmitious: 
* Overlapping graphs

#### Biggest Challenges

Keeping track of multiple users information
Consistent design for data vis
