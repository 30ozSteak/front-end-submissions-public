#### Plan of attach from here: 

1. Get the data now in the store into the details page and get a basic layout
2. Set up router to go to individual lawmaker pages
3. Figure out geolocation and set up controlled form container 
- After that the MVP is met and I will add in mapping and additional data

#### Deliverables for next checkin:
* Details page with lawmaker info on it - make frontend look good
* Geolocation form set up
* Router set up
* Continue testing
* UI for single lawmaker page
