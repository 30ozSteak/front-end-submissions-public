## Project Name:

Stella Via

#### Check In: 3

#### Project Pitch

A mobile app for stargazers that will take a user's geolocation or allow them to search for a location and show them what they can see in the night sky with their naked eye and with a telescope, taking light pollution into account.

### Deliverables

#### Stack:

React Native
Redux
Router
Firebase (if we get to the backend features) (probz node)

Possibly data visualization map with light pollution data

#### Waffle & Github

#### Progress Made
* get geolocation to work
* make search input and button functional
* create page for viewing the night sky and bring in data for night sky
* APOD component working independently
* integrate Sky Map API with location
* calculate sky coordinates (dec and RA)
* create navigation for our app 
* recreate Welcome Page
* filter constellations based on sky coords / earth location (will update math)
* made user modal
* ESLint

#### Next Steps
* get cloud cover data / forecast
* import NPM module auto-complete for cities (like Weathrly)
* BACK END (user for sure, maybe also constellations)
* hopefully hear back from light pollution data people 
* testing!
