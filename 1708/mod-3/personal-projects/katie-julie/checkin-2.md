## Project Name:

Stella Via

#### Check In: 1

A mobile app for stargazers that will take a user's geolocation or allow them to search for a location and show them what they can see in the night sky with their naked eye and with a telescope, taking light pollution into account.

### Deliverables

React Native
Redux
Router
Firebase (if we get to the backend features) (probz node)

Possibly data visualization map with light pollution data
