#### Order Of Attack

1. Get stacks all setup.
2. Build out all necessary components.
3. User should have ability to search for dogs by location, breed, size, and sex.
4. User should hav the ability to create an account.
5. User should have the ability to login.
6. User should be able to save a dog as a 'favorite'.


#### MVP

Non registered-user can find and favorite dogs based off of current location. 
App is well tested. 

#### Nice To Haves

1. Use geolocation to live update some amount of dogs based on your current location.
2. Use google maps to display a map of all possible dogs available to adopt.
3. Have a random 'TOP-DOG' that displays on page load.
4. Having everythign linked to a user. 
5. User can tweet about a dog they're looking at .

##### Unrealistically abmitious:

1. Get a dog while being a Turing student.

#### Biggest Challenges

1. Using google maps API for the first time while displaying a map that will live update.

#### Instructor Notes

#### Deliverables for next checkin:

- Have react, router, and redux setup 
- Find current location and set it in store 
- Have google maps hooked up 
- It would be super nice if you could populate store with dogs.
