Working with the google maps API, and displaying the correct the data.

#### Plan of Attack
Keep researching the google API, and figure out the redux cycle and how the data will fit in.


#### Instructor Notes

- super stoked that you got the data loaded. The only thing I'd like to see is you loading in the CSV locally because 
  a) It's more scalable 
  b) This is an interview question.

- Have google maps loaded 
- have location show presinct
  - verify address // validate address 
  - filter through data set 
- took a stab at papaparse.
