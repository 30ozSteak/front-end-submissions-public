#### Project Pitch

### Deliverables

#### Stack:
React 
Redux
papaparse 

#### APIs:
google maps

#### Wireframes

#### Waffle & Github
Waffle

#### Order Of Attack
- Take very methodically small steps and don't let the scope of the project become overwhelming.

#### MVP
- A map of Summit County (Section of Summit County) that allows a user to type in thier address and find what precincts their property falls under.
- Data is cleaned 
  - Data cleaner is well tested and javascript is clean 


#### Nice To Haves
- Would also show the current-ballot for upcoming elections.
- current talley 
- if user could tweet that they used your app. 

##### Unrealistically abmitious:
Be able to show on the map all 20 precients represented on the map.

#### Biggest Challenges
Working and cleaning a very large data-set, getting better with Redux.

#### Instructor Notes

- you should look into test driving the parsing of your data. 
- narrow your scope to a single section of the map 
- when you're test driving the function / class you're building make sure to use a small set of data. 


#### Deliverables for next checkin:
- Pick a section of the map to deal with 
- Setup the front end of your applicatiom 
  - react, redux
- Start reading in CSV with papa parse 
- Having testing suite built out for unit testing the data cleaner 
  - Consider using PapaParse
