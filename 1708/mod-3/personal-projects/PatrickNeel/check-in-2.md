#### Order Of Attack
Start with a very small data set and try and get it in a workable way that I want.

#### MVP
- A map of Summit County (Section of Summit County) that allows a user to type in thier address and find what precincts their property falls under.
- Data is cleaned 
  - Data cleaner is well tested and javascript is clean 


#### Nice To Haves
- Would also show the current-ballot for upcoming elections.
- current talley 
- if user could tweet that they used your app. 

##### Unrealistically abmitious:
Be able to show on the map all 20 precients represented on the map.

#### Biggest Challenges
The data. Papaparse is confusing to work. I can get the range using lodash. I've got some very small sample data that I'm working on in repil trying to get it the way I want, but it continues to be a challenge.
