## Project Name: Precinct-Pro

#### Check In: 2

#### Project Pitch

### Deliverables Completed
Have the front end set up.
I have the testing suite set up.
I had some tdd going.



#### Biggest Challenges
NPM installed papaparse. Have tried to use it to no avail
Also tried to use a small data set on their website, with no success.
The data. Im'working on manuiplating it. I've installed lodash, which is helping with the range, but to put everything together is hanging me up. Manuiplating the data is still very confusing.

#### Plan of Attack
keep plugging on with the data. If I can get it in a way that I want and that is managable, maybe put it in by hand?
Maybe move on to the map portion with the geoLocation stuff. Then if I get stuck on that move on the base styling, and some testing.

#### Instructor Notes

- when in doubt think really, really, really small 
  - in your test suite start with a test that makes sure your function in your class takes csv and returns an object 
  - expect that you get particular keys 
  - expect those keys have particular values 
  - adding addresses to the address object


#### Deliverables for next checkin:

- TDD the data cleaner 
- Load in a small file and get it runing on the Dom 
- start test driving your React App / REdux app 
- Load in Google Maps
