### Project Scope

A good project idea should:

* Break down into logical iterations so that you can deliver a strong product on every check-in
* Be something that real people would want to use to solve a problem
* Have enough *technical* challenge to be worth your time (as opposed to a *content* challenge)

### Feature Delivery

**1. Completion**

* 3: Developer completed all the user stories and requirements set during check-ins.

### CSS/Design

<!-- - 4 - Developer has made a targeted effort to make the app appealing and user friendly. Evaluator has minimal recommendations for design changes. Follows [10 Essential Usability Guidelines.](https://speckyboy.com/10-essential-web-application-usability-guidelines/)
- 3 - Developer has made a targeted effort to make the app appealing and user friendly. Evaluator has multiple recommendations for design changes. Follows majority of the [10 Essential Usability Guidelines.](https://speckyboy.com/10-essential-web-application-usability-guidelines/)
- 2 - Developer has made intentional design decisions to create a user friendly application but Louisa would be mad. Attempts to follow [10 Essential Usability Guidelines.](https://speckyboy.com/10-essential-web-application-usability-guidelines/) -->
- 1 - Developer did minimal to no CSS for this project besides what was indicated in the comp.

### Code Quality

- 3 - Developer appears comfortable in React. There are minor opportunities to refactor.

### Redux Architecture

* 3: All state changes are handled by Redux with exeception to Controlled Forms. Actions and Reducers are simple. Containers don't hold unnecessary data.

### Code Sanitation

The output from ESLint showsâ€¦

<!-- * 4 - Zero complaints
* 3 - Five or fewer complaints
* 2 - Six to ten complaints -->
* 1 - More than ten complaints

### Testing

<!-- - 4 - Every component is tested from both a unit and acceptance standpoint, all crucial functionality is tested
- 3 - Almost all components are tested to a level that indicates developer has an understanding of testing -->
- 2.5 - A valid attempt was made to test functionality with obvious gaps where functionality is not tested


### Workflow


- 3 - Developer make many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of the application but sometimes contain irrelevant changesets and inconsistent commit messages. Developer use git branches and pull requests when applicable to incorporate changes into the application, and are not pushing fresh changes directly to master. Pull requests may contain little or no code review. There may be slight instances where the developer have committed source code that should be .gitignored. There may be some instances of "dead" or commented-out code and debugger statements like console.log that need to be cleaned up.
