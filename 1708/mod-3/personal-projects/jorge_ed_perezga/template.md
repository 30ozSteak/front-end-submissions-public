#### Project Pitch
HyperBreath focuses on breathing and relaxation techniques to cope with anxiety. These techniques were provided to me by my physiologist and they help me through anxiety and my obsessive compulsive disorder. The app offers a gratitude journal, a collection of positive experience notes that the user always has access to. Additionally, the app gives the user access to various hotline numbers for suicide prevention, sexual assault prevention, LGBTQ support, etc.
