## Completion

#### Were you able to complete the base functionality?

I was able to get all functionality done as well as add functionality that allows the user to update their previously saved palettes.  This seemed like a logical piece of functionality to provide give then design/goals of the app.

#### Which extensions, if any, did you complete?

I did not complete the provided extensions but I did add functionality as noted above.

# Code Quality

#### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you are proud of
[happy code - testing](https://github.com/sljohnson32/palette-picker/blob/master/test/routes.spec.js)

[happy code - saving updated palettes](https://github.com/sljohnson32/palette-picker/blob/master/public/js/scripts.js)

* Why were you proud of this piece of code?

Testing: I am proud of the testing I was able to get in.  I would have liked to have done a bit more sad path testing but I think my test suite is a good first effort.  

Save Palette function: I am also proud of the additional functionality I added to enable the user to save updated palettes (both colors and the name).  I know that this function could be broken out more than it is currently but I think it's an easy to read and clean piece of code that does a complex task.

#### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you feel not great about
[sad code](https://github.com/sljohnson32/palette-picker/blob/master/public/js/scripts.js)

* Why do you feel not awesome about the code? What challenges did you face trying to write/refactor it?

I would have ideally spent more time refactoring my code and breaking out functions more and organizing them into different files.

#### Attach a screenshot or paste the output from your terminal of the result of your test-suite running.

#### Please feel free to ask any other questions or make any other statements below!

This was a good project to get back into the swing of things.  I essentially had to relearn jQuery after not using it for almost a year while also learning Express and Knex.  I feel really good about the server side stuff and feel like it's the missing piece for really being able to get a personal project up and running quickly.
