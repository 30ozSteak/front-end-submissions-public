#### Were you able to complete the base functionality?

N/A

# Code Quality

#### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub that you are proud of
[happy code](https://github.com/danalvarez5280/Palette-Picker/issues/13)

* I was happy with this code, mainly because it was the last thing I did and it worked pretty much right away. I was also about to grab the id i needed for the delete fetch functionality quickly.

#### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub that you feel not great about
[sad code](https://github.com/danalvarez5280/Palette-Picker/issues/14)

* I dont really know that I understand the premise of the seed when it comes to the testing. I feel like I was supposed to set up a seed/test file but I am not really sure. My tests are apssing for the most part but there are two that either have an issue with what I'm sending to the endpoint or what is being returned by the end point.

#### Attach a screenshot or paste the output from your terminal of the result of your test-suite running.

#### Please feel free to ask any other questions or make any other statements below!

I feel bad that I did not finish what should be a roughly simple aspect of the project. As well I lost too much time to a stupid mistake. I was running my app on my file path instead of localhost:300. As well I feel like I woud like to know about the testing a bit more. I was able to get most all to pass, but it bothers me why I'm getting 422 errors and 500 errors no matter what I change in the test file or server.js file.
