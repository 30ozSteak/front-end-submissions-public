## Completion

#### Were you able to complete the base functionality?

I believe I was able to complete everything aside from diplaying the hexcodes when you click on a palette name. I wrote tests that mostly pass. The before all hook is causing it to fail du to time outs.

#### Which extensions, if any, did you complete?

N/A

# Code Quality

#### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub that you are proud of
[happy code](https://github.com/danalvarez5280/Palette-Picker/issues/13)

* I was happy with this code, mainly because it was the last thing I did and it worked pretty much right away. I was also about to grab the id i needed for the delete fetch functionality quickly.

#### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub that you feel not great about
[sad code](https://github.com/danalvarez5280/Palette-Picker/issues/14)

* I dont really know that I understand the premise of the seed when it comes to the testing. I feel like I was supposed to set up a seed/test file but I am not really sure.

#### Attach a screenshot or paste the output from your terminal of the result of your test-suite running.

#### Please feel free to ask any other questions or make any other statements below!

I feel bad that I did not finish what should be a roughly simple aspect of the project. As well I lost too much time to a stupid mistake. I was running my app on my file path instead of localhost:300.
