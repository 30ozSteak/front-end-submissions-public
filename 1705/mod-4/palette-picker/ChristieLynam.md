## Completion

#### Were you able to complete the base functionality?

If not, explain what is missing and why.

No, I am still working on being able to click on the palette name and the palette and have those colors show in the generator.

#### Which extensions, if any, did you complete?

none.... but hope to complete being able to change a color in the generator

# Code Quality

#### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub that you are proud of
[happy code](https://github.com/christielynam/palette-picker/blob/master/public/js/scripts.js#L63-L75)

* Why were you proud of this piece of code?

This may totally be bad practice (not sure), but I was proud of making a nested fetch call for each project to append that projects palettes on page load. 

#### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub that you feel not great about
[sad code](https://github.com/christielynam/palette-picker/blob/master/public/js/scripts.js#L30-L61)

* Why do you feel not awesome about the code? What challenges did you face trying to write/refactor it?

I feel like I should probably be able to do this with one function, but have just not had the time to do a major refactor since I am still trying to complete base functionality and testing.

#### Attach a screenshot or paste the output from your terminal of the result of your test-suite running.

#### Please feel free to ask any other questions or make any other statements below!

I would greatly appreciate the opportunity to to finish this project over the weekend. I have enjoyed working on this project... I have just been unable to complete all of the requirements in the alloted time frame.
