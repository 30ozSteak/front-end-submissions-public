## Completion

#### Were you able to complete the base functionality?

If not, explain what is missing and why.

Yes, with the exception of 1 minor bug. When i click the delete icon, I originally get a 500 error (/api/v1/palettes/undefined). When I refresh the page and click it again, it removes the palette from the database correctly.

#### Which extensions, if any, did you complete?

N/A

# Code Quality

#### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub that you are proud of
[happy code](https://github.com/christielynam/palette-picker/blob/master/public/js/scripts.js#L20-L32)

* Why were you proud of this piece of code?

I was proud of making a nested fetch call for each project to append that projects palettes on page load. 

#### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub that you feel not great about
[sad code](https://github.com/christielynam/palette-picker/blob/master/public/js/scripts.js#L44-L59)
[more sad code](https://github.com/christielynam/palette-picker/blob/master/public/js/scripts.js#L102-L116)

* Why do you feel not awesome about the code? What challenges did you face trying to write/refactor it?

I feel like I should probably be able to write both append palette functions with one function, but have just not had the time to do a major refactor.

#### Attach a screenshot or paste the output from your terminal of the result of your test-suite running.
