This project was fun, but there was a lot to learn and to accomplish crammed into 4 days. Maybe spread this project out over a longer period of time so students can feel confident in their learning and complee the project. I feel like I sacrificed parts of my learning for the sake of trying to get more of the project done, and I'm not comfortable with that.

Anything else you wanna say!
