# Code Quality

#### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub that you are proud of
[happy code](https://github.com/lcaroselli/palette-picker/commit/7b137592581e610b7c5ce664b86644e5696491f2)

* Why were you proud of this piece of code?
I was finally able to get the page to update the DOM with projects and palettes without needed to refresh - it took a while to think this logic through.

#### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub that you feel not great about
[sad code]()
Nothing specific, but I am aware that there is a bit of code duplication going on and I could have refactored a lot of the functionality for displaying projects and palettes to the page.


#### Attach a screenshot or paste the output from your terminal of the result of your test-suite running.
[test suite]()
My test suite is running sporadically and I think it has something to do with the server it's trying to run on, but I can't figure out how to fix it. All tests passed before trying to run my project with nodemon again...

#### Please feel free to ask any other questions or make any other statements below!

This project was fun, but there was a lot to learn and to accomplish crammed into 4 days. Maybe spread this project out over a longer period of time so students can feel confident in their learning and complete the project. I feel like I sacrificed parts of my learning for the sake of trying to get more of the project done, and I'm not comfortable with that.

Anything else you wanna say!
