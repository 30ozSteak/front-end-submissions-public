## Completion

#### Were you able to complete the base functionality?

I was able to complete all functionality. I would like to write an endpoint to delete projects, and plan on doing that. I for some reason am having a hard time with my DELETE test and couldn't figure it out.

#### Which extensions, if any, did you complete?

I did not complete any extensions

# Code Quality

#### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub that you are proud of
[happy code](https://github.com/jackmallahan/palette-picker/blob/c1992b1ec7b959182abcf8008fd92e248db2a9ce/public/js/scripts.js#L29-L43)

* Why were you proud of this piece of code?
I just thought this was a fun piece of code. The front end stuff like this is what I really enjoy writing. Making my title have random colors for each letter is a completely superfluous function, but it is fun.

#### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub that you feel not great about
[sad code](https://github.com/jackmallahan/palette-picker/blob/51bf12b00c2741c11d9bc5d3f7837253ba85b62e/test/routes.spec.js#L226-L235)

* Why do you feel not awesome about the code? What challenges did you face trying to write/refactor it?

I don't like this code because I have no idea why it doesn't work. I asked a couple of classmates and they had theirs very similarly. I don't know why it doesn't work.

#### Attach a screenshot or paste the output from your terminal of the result of your test-suite running.

#### Please feel free to ask any other questions or make any other statements below!

I made some good progress and wrote some code that I am definitely proud of. I really enjoyed writing the front end code for this and had fun with that. I think this was a good introduction to writing with Express and I definitely need to hone my skills in this area. Plus I got to name this file jacks-pp and that makes me laugh.
