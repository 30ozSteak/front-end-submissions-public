## Completion

#### Were you able to complete the base functionality?

I was able to complete the base functionality requirements! 

#### Which extensions, if any, did you complete?

I was not able to complete any extensions, I would like to complete functionality for proper deletion of entire projects. I am mostly there but I need to add an acurate icon that serves as a visual to the user and I need to appropriately link the event handler so that I avoid removing parts from the DOM. 

# Code Quality

#### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub that you are proud of
happy code:

* Why were you proud of this piece of code?

- Lines 177 to 200 of scripts.js file. Although it does seem like a function that could use some refactoring, it took me quite some time to get to this resolution, and I was proud of the new approach that I finally decided upon using $.makeArray(). I had several bugs to work through in the solution of updating the large palette generator view with a selection from the saved list. Initially I did not think this would take me as long as it did, and therefore I am proud of the result from the struggle.

#### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub that you feel not great about
sad code:

* Why do you feel not awesome about the code? What challenges did you face trying to write/refactor it?

- Lines 91 - 137 of scripts.js file. I feel like this function could use much refactoring to make it cleaner and substantially shorter. I made an attempt throught my work on the project and ended up with a series of bugs or broken functionality. I would like to take more time to look over this code and figure out how to make it cleaner. 

#### Attach a screenshot or paste the output from your terminal of the result of your test-suite running.

Anything else you wanna say!

- This project was a very great challenge for me. I often feel like it takes me more time than I have to wrap my head around how to approach tasks to have a well functioning project. I honestly did not think that I would make it though this project. I find I do work better in paired projects when I have someone to collaborate ideas with. Overall I am proud of the growth and learning that has taken place for me throughout the project and I need to remind myself to be more confident with the skills I have gained in a short period of time.
