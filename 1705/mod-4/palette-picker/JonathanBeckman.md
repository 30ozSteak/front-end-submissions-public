## Completion

If not, explain what is missing and why.

I was able to complete the basice functionality

#### Which extensions, if any, did you complete?

I was able to add the functionality of editing the color value of a single color swatch on the main palette.

# Code Quality

#### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub that you are proud of
- this is an array of the colors of a specific palette
[happy code](https://github.com/jbexx/Palette-Picker/blob/master/public/js/scripts.js#L62)
- this loops through that array and appends them to the main palette
[happy code](https://github.com/jbexx/Palette-Picker/blob/master/public/js/scripts.js#L146-L153)

* Why were you proud of this piece of code?

Because it took me a while to figure out how to handle an array in a string in html

#### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub that you feel not great about
[sad code](https://github.com/jbexx/Palette-Picker/blob/master/public/js/scripts.js#L179-L190)

* Why do you feel not awesome about the code? What challenges did you face trying to write/refactor it?

I'd like to have these event listeners inline but having to call e.preventDefault because these button are in a form kept me from doing that.  I suppose a point of refactoring would be to move the e.preventDefault into the function Im calling to have the event listeners as one line.
