# Code Quality

#### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub that you are proud of
[happy code](https://github.com/Kalikoze/Palette-Picker/blob/master/public/js/scripts.js#L120-L128)

* Why were you proud of this piece of code?

I was pretty excited about this function partially because it's the first time I've used the data attribute.  It was pretty awesome to be able to store the hex value within the data attribute of the HTML element and then save it for later.  I was also excited to be able to not only get the value of each color, but also assign the color to the colors on the main page all within the same loop.  

#### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub that you feel not great about
[sad code](https://github.com/Kalikoze/Palette-Picker/blob/master/public/js/scripts.js#L81-L99)

* Why do you feel not awesome about the code? What challenges did you face trying to write/refactor it?

I think it was just more frustrating to me about having to send each color in an array as separate values, since knex does not take arrays easily.  I feel like this could get messy especially if you had more than 5 values.  What if you had 20 hex values or some other kind of data?  Would you have to literally store each one as a string?  I'm just curious how I could go about this better next time.  Thank you!!!

#### Please feel free to ask any other questions or make any other statements below!

This was a pretty fun project.  I was nervous about doing the backend in the beginning, but I have a better understanding of it now after this project.   I know I've still got plenty to learn, and am excited to get your comments back so I can do better next time.  Cheers!
