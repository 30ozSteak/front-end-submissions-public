## Evaluator: Louisa
## Optional Notes:

Really nicely done! Great work -- very tidy and well factored code. Many interesting approaches to refactoring that we don't see in mod1, they really ran with the spirit of a refactor and the result is really nicely executed codebase.

## Functional Expectations

|Exceptional        | Application meets all of the expectations of both phases and one or more of the extensions. |

------------------------------------------------------------------

## HTML

#### Accessibility

|Exceptional        | Can run markup through a variety of online accessibility tools and score well for content, color, screen readers, etc. |

#### Style

|Exceptional        | Crafts lean, efficient markup and can speak directly to choices made to improve performance, including but not limited to, page load times, css/js optimizations, image optimizations. |

------------------------------------------------------------------

## CSS

#### Structure of Code

|Exceptional        | Understands the performance implications surrounding cascading/specificity and crafts CSS that is mindful of reducing complexity and increasing performance.|

#### Implementation

|Exceptional        | Can articulate rationale for all parts of the CSS implementation (each line of code/CSS rule) specifically in regards to the balance of: structure of code, design integrity, performance.|

------------------------------------------------------------------

## JAVASCRIPT

#### Data Types

|Proficient         | Can identify and track data types through any variety of functions, understanding their affect and result on each line of code. Knows which scenarios are better suited for objects vs. arrays and employs them accordingly.|

#### Conditional Logic

|Proficient         | Can use an if/esle statement to effectively handle multiple paths through the code. Writes if/else statements that only have one level of logic (no nesting). Can use logical operators instead of if/else statements where applicable.|

#### Functions & Scope

|Exceptional        | Comfortable with using callback functions where applicable. Comfortable returning collections from functions (objects, arrays).|

#### Arrays

|Exceptional        | Uses variety array prototypes to iterate through arrays and manipulate/create new arrays without using documentation as a resource.|

#### Objects & Prototypes

|Proficient         | Can use object prototypes. Can articulate the definition and the "why" of an object prototype - the best use cases for prototypes.|

#### DOM Manipulation

|Exceptional        | Understands the potential performance impact imposed by leveraging vanilla JavaScript vs. jQuery in their implementation and will make choices accordingly based on the problem to solve.|

#### Style

|Exceptional        | Application demonstrates excellent knowledge of JavaScript syntax, style, and refactoring. Application has exceptionally well-factored code with little or no duplication. |

------------------------------------------------------------------

## GIT & GITHUB

#### Git

|Proficient         | Commits changes frequently with detailed commit messages. Uses feature branches to keep master branch free of incomplete features or bugs.|

#### Github

|Proficient         | Is comfortable with resolving merge conflicts. Asks for review/merge of their pull requests from teammates. Is comfortable editing code based on review feedback from a pull request and resubmitting the branch code.|

------------------------------------------------------------------

## DESIGN

#### Design Concepts

|Proficient         | Can apply fundamental design concepts in a comp that demonstrates a thoughtful, purposeful, cohesive strategy that does not detract from legibility or overall design integrity.  |

------------------------------------------------------------------

## PAIRING

#### Collaboration

|Proficient         | Can diplomatically handle issues that arise between the pair through respectful, focused, targeted feedback and implement changes to positively adapt the working relationship and keep the project on track. Can effectively implement tactics to support their partner's learning and project goals, while also honoring their own personal learning and project goals, should the two be different or at different levels due to skill delta. |
