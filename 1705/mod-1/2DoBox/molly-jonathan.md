## Optional Notes:

Good job! Very nicely done, great team work, really captured the spirit of refactoring a codebase.

------------------------------------------------------------------

## Functional Expectations

|Exceptional        | Application meets all of the expectations of both phases and one or more of the extensions. |

------------------------------------------------------------------

## HTML

#### Accessibility

|Proficient         | Employs detailed accessibility practices throughout markup, especially in forms and can speak to decisions made in accessibility choices as it relates to specific accessibility concerns. |

#### Style

|Proficient         | Crafts lean, efficient markup that is easy to read and follow across naming conventions, structure, and solid formatting that follows industry best practices. |

------------------------------------------------------------------

## CSS

#### Structure of Code

|Proficient         | Leverages cascading styles and CSS specificity rules to create more complex targeting of elements in order to reduce, reuse, share styles across elements. Organizes properties within rules based upon industry standard principles of writing consistent, idiomatic CSS. |

#### Implementation

|Proficient         | Develops layouts that work cross-browser, are responsive, and can logically defend the choices made in implementation approach for layout. |

------------------------------------------------------------------

## JAVASCRIPT

#### Data Types

|Proficient         | Can identify and track data types through any variety of functions, understanding their affect and result on each line of code. Knows which scenarios are better suited for objects vs. arrays and employs them accordingly.|

#### Conditional Logic

|Proficient         | Can use an if/esle statement to effectively handle multiple paths through the code. Writes if/else statements that only have one level of logic (no nesting). Can use logical operators instead of if/else statements where applicable.|

#### Functions & Scope

|Proficient         | Functions have single responsibility. The entirety of the function is easy to read what functionality it contains. Function is generally shorter than 8 lines. Uses functions to eliminate repeated code. Comfortable refactoring any piece of code and extracting it to a function.|

#### Arrays

|Proficient         | Does not use for loops for arrays - uses array prototypes, such as forEach, to iterate through or manipulate arrays. Can use array to store more complicated data structures such as objects or nested arrays. Is comfortable/efficient with reading array prototype documentation and can efficiently test/apply array prototype methods they have not worked with before.|

#### Objects & Prototypes

|Proficient         | Can use object prototypes. Can articulate the definition and the "why" of an object prototype - the best use cases for prototypes.|

#### DOM Manipulation

|Proficient         | Able to extract information, modify attributes, or append/prepend data in the DOM easily regardless of whether they are employing vanilla JavaScript or jQuery. Understands how to harness event bubbling.|

#### Style

|Proficient         | Code is logically organized, such that reader can easily follow the progression of the app because variable and function names are descriptive and follow a single responsibility approach. There are no major bugs and minimal duplication.|

------------------------------------------------------------------

## GIT & GITHUB

#### Git

|Proficient         | Commits changes frequently with detailed commit messages. Uses feature branches to keep master branch free of incomplete features or bugs.|

#### Github

|Proficient         | Is comfortable with resolving merge conflicts. Asks for review/merge of their pull requests from teammates. Is comfortable editing code based on review feedback from a pull request and resubmitting the branch code.|

------------------------------------------------------------------

## DESIGN

#### Design Concepts

|Proficient         | Can apply fundamental design concepts in a comp that demonstrates a thoughtful, purposeful, cohesive strategy that does not detract from legibility or overall design integrity.  |

------------------------------------------------------------------

## PAIRING

#### Collaboration

|Proficient         | Can diplomatically handle issues that arise between the pair through respectful, focused, targeted feedback and implement changes to positively adapt the working relationship and keep the project on track. Can effectively implement tactics to support their partner's learning and project goals, while also honoring their own personal learning and project goals, should the two be different or at different levels due to skill delta. |
