## Evaluator: Louisa
## Optional Notes:

through phase 4

Great work building out the UI! Really nicely done, extremely solid execution, very nice responsive solution.

Paired very effectively together. Used github really well, leveraged all the tools (commits, issues, etc). Great team work! As usual, any HTML and CSS that Christie works on is extremely well executed and implemented.

Very clean code, well structured, they both owned the entire code base, very even distribution of work/effort.

### Functional Expectations

* __Exceptional__ You completed Phase Three and did something with Phase Four.

------------------------------------------------------------------


## HTML

#### Accessibility

|Exceptional        | Can run markup through a variety of online accessibility tools and score well for content, color, screen readers, etc. |

#### Style

|Exceptional        | Crafts lean, efficient markup and can speak directly to choices made to improve performance, including but not limited to, page load times, css/js optimizations, image optimizations. |


## CSS

#### Structure of Code

|Exceptional        | Understands the performance implications surrounding cascading/specificity and crafts CSS that is mindful of reducing complexity and increasing performance.|

#### Implementation

|Exceptional        | Can articulate rationale for all parts of the CSS implementation (each line of code/CSS rule) specifically in regards to the balance of: structure of code, design integrity, performance.|


## JAVASCRIPT

#### Conditional Logic

|Proficient         | Can use an if/else statement to effectively handle multiple paths through the code. Writes if/else statements that only have one level of logic (no nesting). Can use logical operators instead of if/else statements where applicable.|

#### Functions & Scope

|Proficient         | Functions have single responsibility. The entirety of the function is easy to read what functionality it contains. Function is generally shorter than 8 lines. Uses functions to eliminate repeated code. Comfortable refactoring any piece of code and extracting it to a function.|


#### DOM Manipulation

|Proficient         | Able to extract information, modify attributes, or append/prepend data in the DOM easily regardless of whether they are employing vanilla JavaScript or jQuery. Understands how to harness event bubbling.|

#### Style

|Proficient         | Code is logically organized, such that reader can easily follow the progression of the app because variable and function names are descriptive and follow a single responsibility approach. There are no major bugs and minimal duplication.|


## GIT & GITHUB

#### Git

|Exceptional        | Knows how to reset to previous commits, rebase large sets of small commits, if applicable, and other advanced Git maneuvers. |

#### Github

|Exceptional        | Uses issues as resource for project management. There are comments on specific lines of pull requests with discussion about the implementation.|


## DESIGN

#### Comp Recreation

|Exceptional        | Developer skillfully captures the spirit and design intent of all comp details. Execution is pixel-perfect and any design decisions left open to interpretation are solved intentionally, are as seamless as if the designer had provided the solution, are handled gracefully, and enhance the overall design.|


## PAIRING

#### Collaboration

|Exceptional        | Pair collaboration and communication is exceptional, with the distribution of work being equal and balanced, and both partners experiencing a good working flow, able to handle stress, deadlines, issues with calm and focused demeanor.|
