## Optional Notes:

through phase 4

Great work building out the UI! Really nicely done, extremely solid execution, very nice responsive solution.

Paired very effectively together. Used github really well, leveraged all the tools (commits, issues, etc). Great team work!

Very clean code, well structured, they both owned the entire code base, very even distribution of work/effort

## JAVASCRIPT

#### Conditional Logic

|Novice             | Can understand when an expression evaluates to true or false.|

|Proficient         | Can use an if/else statement to effectively handle multiple paths through the code. Writes if/else statements that only have one level of logic (no nesting). Can use logical operators instead of if/else statements where applicable.|
|Exceptional        | Can write conditional logic that is succinct and easy to read. Logic can handle all situations where user gives incorrect/unexpected input.|

|Exceptional        | Can write conditional logic that is succinct and easy to read. Logic can handle all situations where user gives incorrect/unexpected input.|

#### Functions & Scope

|Novice             | Can write a simple function that takes at least one input argument.|
|Advanced Beginner  | Developer is comfortable using multiple arguments to pass data into functions. Understands how variables are scoped at the function level and global level. Functions are named descriptively. Knows when and why to use return in a function.|
|Proficient         | Functions have single responsibility. The entirety of the function is easy to read what functionality it contains. Function is generally shorter than 8 lines. Uses functions to eliminate repeated code. Comfortable refactoring any piece of code and extracting it to a function.|
|Exceptional        | Comfortable with using callback functions where applicable. Comfortable returning collections from functions (objects, arrays).|


#### DOM Manipulation

|Novice             | Can articulate what the DOM is and can effectively target elements in vanilla JavaScript via class, id, or tag.|
|Advanced Beginner  | Can add event listeners and create small functions that execute on events, can leverage the event object appropriately, and can articulate the what/why/how of jQuery.|
|Proficient         | Able to extract information, modify attributes, or append/prepend data in the DOM easily regardless of whether they are employing vanilla JavaScript or jQuery. Understands how to harness event bubbling.|
|Exceptional        | Understands the potential performance impact imposed by leveraging vanilla JavaScript vs. jQuery in their implementation and will make choices accordingly based on the problem to solve.|

#### Style

|Novice             | Can explain the choices made in the overall codebase and is able to articulate what every line of code is doing. Code is neatly formatted and easy to read with correct indentation.|
|Advanced Beginner  | Code shows strong effort toward organization, but suffers from long functions, unnecessary or poorly named variables, and requires significant refactoring. Application may have some duplication and minor bugs. |
|Proficient         | Code is logically organized, such that reader can easily follow the progression of the app because variable and function names are descriptive and follow a single responsibility approach. There are no major bugs and minimal duplication.|

|Proficient         | Developer captures the spirit and design intent of the comp. Some small details need polish to achieve a pixel-perfect match to the comp, but developer is clearly mindful of details and has made a conscious and careful effort to match the comp. Any design decisions left open to interpretation are handled thoughtfully and are well executed, but are more noticable and/or unintuative than they would be if the designer had provided the solution, or may not be totally seamless during screen-size transitions.|
|Exceptional        | Developer skillfully captures the spirit and design intent of all comp details. Execution is pixel-perfect and any design decisions left open to interpretation are solved intentionally, are as seamless as if the designer had provided the solution, are handled gracefully, and enhance the overall design.|
