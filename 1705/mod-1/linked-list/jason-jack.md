## Optional Notes:

Through phase 4

Nicely done! Really good job, good distribution of

UI is a little bit too wide on big screens, so have a max-width that kicks in to control line lengths.


### Functional Expectations

* __Exceptional__ You completed Phase Three and did something with Phase Four.

#### Functions & Scope

|Proficient         | Functions have single responsibility. The entirety of the function is easy to read what functionality it contains. Function is generally shorter than 8 lines. Uses functions to eliminate repeated code. Comfortable refactoring any piece of code and extracting it to a function.|


#### DOM Manipulation

|Proficient         | Commits changes frequently with detailed commit messages. Uses feature branches to keep master branch free of incomplete features or bugs.|

#### Github

Use pull requests!

|Advanced Beginner  | Can execute basic pull requests with context about changes in description. Can keep local and GitHub repositories in sync.|


## DESIGN

#### Comp Recreation

|Proficient         | Developer captures the spirit and design intent of the comp. Some small details need polish to achieve a pixel-perfect match to the comp, but developer is clearly mindful of details and has made a conscious and careful effort to match the comp.

## PAIRING
