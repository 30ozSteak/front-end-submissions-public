### Functional Expectations

* __Exceptional__ You completed Phase Three and did something with Phase Four.
  - Slightly buggy on the remove all read if things are already deleted.

------------------------------------------------------------------

## HTML

#### Accessibility

|Advanced Beginner  | Leverages more precise semantic tags when applicable, and employs basic ARIA roles attributes for added clarity in structure, descriptive image alt attributes, title attributes for applicable anchor tags. |

#### Style

|Proficient         | Crafts lean, efficient markup that is easy to read and follow across naming conventions, structure, and solid formatting that follows industry best practices. |


## CSS

#### Structure of Code

|Proficient         | Leverages cascading styles and CSS specificity rules to create more complex targeting of elements in order to reduce, reuse, share styles across elements. Organizes properties within rules based upon industry standard principles of writing consistent, idiomatic CSS. |

#### Implementation

|Advanced Beginner  | Can articulate the differences between the approaches of absolute/relative positioning, flex-box, floats, and can appropriately apply the approaches to solve a variety of layout problems.|


## JAVASCRIPT

#### Conditional Logic

|Proficient         | Can use an if/else statement to effectively handle multiple paths through the code. Writes if/else statements that only have one level of logic (no nesting). Can use logical operators instead of if/else statements where applicable.|

#### Functions & Scope

|Proficient         | Functions have single responsibility. The entirety of the function is easy to read what functionality it contains. Function is generally shorter than 8 lines. Uses functions to eliminate repeated code. Comfortable refactoring any piece of code and extracting it to a function.|


#### DOM Manipulation

|Proficient         | Able to extract information, modify attributes, or append/prepend data in the DOM easily regardless of whether they are employing vanilla JavaScript or jQuery. Understands how to harness event bubbling.|

#### Style

|Proficient         | Code is logically organized, such that reader can easily follow the progression of the app because variable and function names are descriptive and follow a single responsibility approach. There are no major bugs and minimal duplication.|


## GIT & GITHUB

#### Git

|Novice             | Can use commits and can articulate what a commit is and why we use them. Makes large, infrequent commits directly to master branch. |
|Advanced Beginner  | Can create branches and willingly attempts to incorporate branches into their workflow. Commits, while infrequent, are increased in volume and show improvements in description. |

#### Github

|Advanced Beginner  | Can execute basic pull requests with context about changes in description. Can keep local and GitHub repositories in sync.|


## DESIGN

#### Comp Recreation

<!-- |Advanced Beginner  | Can accomplish about 50-75% of the large and small design details and can logically rework them on at least 1 breakpoint. |
 -- Pending fixing of mobile view
 -->
|Proficient         | Developer captures the spirit and design intent of the comp. Some small details need polish to achieve a pixel-perfect match to the comp, but developer is clearly mindful of details and has made a conscious and careful effort to match the comp. Any design decisions left open to interpretation are handled thoughtfully and are well executed, but are more noticable and/or unintuative than they would be if the designer had provided the solution, or may not be totally seamless during screen-size transitions.|


## PAIRING

#### Collaboration

Would love to see BOTH partners speak equally during evaluation. Heavily weighted code review from one partner indicates that there was a disconnect between who wrote the code -  its up to both developers to make sure everyone is on the same page and can speak to every line of code written.

|Advanced Beginner  | Can identify deltas in skill level and collaborate on methods whereby both pairs can share equitably in the workload. Can revisit the DTR to address changes that arise, and/or simply to keep one another reminded of the working plan.|
