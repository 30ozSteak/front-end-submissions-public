## Evaluator: Louisa
## Optional Notes:

Well done. Very tidy, good attention to details. Could use a refactoring pass, but overall a strong effort for the first project.

### Functional Expectations

* __Proficient:__ Application meets all of the functional expectations in Phase Three.

------------------------------------------------------------------

## HTML

#### Accessibility

* __Proficient:__ Employs detailed accessibility practices throughout markup, especially in forms and can speak to decisions made in accessibility choices as it relates to specific accessibility concerns.

#### Style

* __Proficient:__ Crafts lean, efficient markup that is easy to read and follow across naming conventions, structure, and solid formatting that follows industry best practices.

------------------------------------------------------------------

## CSS

#### Structure of Code

* __Proficient__ : Leverages cascading styles and CSS specificity rules to create more complex targeting of elements in order to reduce, reuse, share styles across elements. Organizes properties within rules based upon industry standard principles of writing consistent, idiomatic CSS.

#### Implementation

* __Advanced Beginner:__ Can articulate the differences between the approaches of absolute/relative positioning, flex-box, floats, and can appropriately apply the approaches to solve a variety of layout problems.

------------------------------------------------------------------

## JAVASCRIPT

#### Conditional Logic

* __Advanced Beginner:__ Uses if/else statements, but there are multiple levels of nesting, which makes the paths through the code difficult to follow. Understands what is "truthy" and "falsey" in JavaScript.

#### Functions & Scope

* __Advanced Beginner:__ Developer is comfortable using multiple arguments to pass data into functions. Understands how variables are scoped at the function level and global level. Functions are named descriptively. Knows when and why to use return in a function.

#### DOM Manipulation

* __Proficient:__ Able to extract information, modify attributes, or append/prepend data in the DOM easily regardless of whether they are employing vanilla JavaScript or jQuery. Understands how to harness event bubbling.

#### Style

* __Proficient:__ Code is logically organized, such that reader can easily follow the progression of the app because variable and function names are descriptive and follow a single responsibility approach. There are no major bugs and minimal duplication.

------------------------------------------------------------------

## DESIGN

#### Comp Recreation

* __Proficient:__ Developer captures the spirit and design intent of the comp. Some small details need polish to achieve a pixel-perfect match to the comp, but developer is clearly mindful of details and has made a conscious and careful effort to match the comp. Any design decisions left open to interpretation are handled thoughtfully and are well executed, but are more noticable and/or unintuative than they would be if the designer had provided the solution, or may not be totally seamless during screen-size transitions.
