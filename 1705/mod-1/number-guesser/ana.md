## Evaluator: Louisa
## Optional Notes:

Is feeling a bit shaky with version control, had multiple versions of the project in multiple directories. Good attention to details like indentation and organization.

Overall, well done! Definitely keep working on version control!

### Functional Expectations

* __Advanced Beginner:__  Application meets all of the functional expectations in Phase Two.

------------------------------------------------------------------

## HTML

#### Accessibility

* __Advanced Beginner:__ Leverages more precise semantic tags when applicable, and employs basic ARIA roles attributes for added clarity in structure, descriptive image alt attributes, title attributes for applicable anchor tags.

#### Style

* __Proficient:__ Crafts lean, efficient markup that is easy to read and follow across naming conventions, structure, and solid formatting that follows industry best practices.

------------------------------------------------------------------

## CSS

#### Structure of Code

* __Proficient__ : Leverages cascading styles and CSS specificity rules to create more complex targeting of elements in order to reduce, reuse, share styles across elements. Organizes properties within rules based upon industry standard principles of writing consistent, idiomatic CSS.

#### Implementation

* __Advanced Beginner:__ Can articulate the differences between the approaches of absolute/relative positioning, flex-box, floats, and can appropriately apply the approaches to solve a variety of layout problems.

------------------------------------------------------------------

## JAVASCRIPT

#### Conditional Logic

* __Advanced Beginner:__ Uses if/else statements, but there are multiple levels of nesting, which makes the paths through the code difficult to follow. Understands what is "truthy" and "falsey" in JavaScript.

#### Functions & Scope

* __Advanced Beginner:__ Developer is comfortable using multiple arguments to pass data into functions. Understands how variables are scoped at the function level and global level. Functions are named descriptively. Knows when and why to use return in a function.

#### DOM Manipulation

* __Proficient:__ Able to extract information, modify attributes, or append/prepend data in the DOM easily regardless of whether they are employing vanilla JavaScript or jQuery. Understands how to harness event bubbling.

#### Style

* __Advanced Beginner:__ Code shows strong effort toward organization, but suffers from long functions, unnecessary or poorly named variables, and requires significant refactoring. Application may have some duplication and minor bugs.

------------------------------------------------------------------

## DESIGN

#### Comp Recreation

* __Advanced Beginner:__ Can accomplish about 50-75% of the large and small design details and can logically rework them on at least 1 breakpoint.
