## Evaluator: Brenna

## Optional Notes:  
  - Keep an eye on which Aria roles you're using
  - Pay close attention to width/spacing in your UI
  - Great work isolating variables and event listeners and making sure your tabbing/indentation is consistent!
  - A couple places where we could reduce duplication
  - If you're using a function declaration you won't need to redefine it as a variable

### Functional Expectations

* __Advanced Beginner:__  Application meets all of the functional expectations in Phase Two.

------------------------------------------------------------------

## HTML

#### Accessibility

* __Advanced Beginner:__ Leverages more precise semantic tags when applicable, and employs basic ARIA roles attributes for added clarity in structure, descriptive image alt attributes, title attributes for applicable anchor tags.

#### Style

* __Advanced Beginner:__ Crafts markup with proper and logical nesting.
* __Proficient:__ Crafts lean, efficient markup that is easy to read and follow across naming conventions, structure, and solid formatting that follows industry best practices.

------------------------------------------------------------------

## CSS

#### Structure of Code

* __Advanced Beginner:__ Can cleanly and logically organize CSS rules according to similar categories (i.e. typography, layout, components), and then logically organize the remaining CSS rules based on flow of the markup. Organizes properties within rules alphabetically.

#### Implementation

* __Novice:__ Can articulate how the CSS box model works and apply it appropriately in a static layout.
* __Advanced Beginner:__ Can articulate the differences between the approaches of absolute/relative positioning, flex-box, floats, and can appropriately apply the approaches to solve a variety of layout problems.

------------------------------------------------------------------

## JAVASCRIPT

#### Conditional Logic

* __Advanced Beginner:__ Uses if/else statements, but there are multiple levels of nesting, which makes the paths through the code difficult to follow. Understands what is "truthy" and "falsey" in JavaScript.

#### Functions & Scope

* __Novice__ : Can write a simple function that takes at least one input argument.
* __Advanced Beginner:__ Developer is comfortable using multiple arguments to pass data into functions. Understands how variables are scoped at the function level and global level. Functions are named descriptively. Knows when and why to use return in a function.

#### DOM Manipulation

* __Novice:__ Can articulate what the DOM is and can effectively target elements in vanilla JavaScript via class, id, or tag.
* __Advanced Beginner:__ Can add event listeners and create small functions that execute on events, can leverage the event object appropriately, and can articulate the what/why/how of jQuery.

#### Style

* __Advanced Beginner:__ Code shows strong effort toward organization, but suffers from long functions, unnecessary or poorly named variables, and requires significant refactoring. Application may have some duplication and minor bugs.
* __Proficient:__ Code is logically organized, such that reader can easily follow the progression of the app because variable and function names are descriptive and follow a single responsibility approach. There are no major bugs and minimal duplication.

------------------------------------------------------------------

## DESIGN

#### Comp Recreation

* __Novice:__ Can establish a complementary color palette, integrate font(s), and execute a handful of the large comp details.
* __Advanced Beginner:__ Can accomplish about 50-75% of the large and small design details and can logically rework them on at least 1 breakpoint.
