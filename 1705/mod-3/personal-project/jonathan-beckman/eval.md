# TO DO:

* Last screen needs another option
  * Home button (or another nav option so I am not dead-ended)
  * Header to indicate what language I'm seeing

* Write one test at least

* Button to handle next step...
   * Save to Images
   * Copy Text (that then opens list of options like email, message, save, etc.)
   * Toggle Button to see original translation vs translated text toggle
