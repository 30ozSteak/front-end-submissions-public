## Project Name: ConnectME

#### Check In: 1

#### Project Pitch

When you're travelling to a city, the first thing you do is try to think about who you know. Facebook, although a good platform for finding friends in a particular city or messaging one particular person, the two are quite disconnected. Couchsurfing provided us with a good start to finding people in cities to crash with and Facebook provided a good start to finding friends in a particular city. ConnectME will provide a better platform for finding those friends and then messaging them for coffee, dinner, or a place to stay. With this web application, you will be able to search your friend list with a specific city filter and have access to the information while trying to message these people. 

### Deliverables

#### Stack: React, Redux, Router, Firebase, SASS/SCSS

#### APIs: Facebook Graph API, Google map API - pins on the map with users (filter based off of this map)

#### Wireframes: Images in folder

#### Waffle & Github: https://waffle.io/davidbecker6081/ConnectMe, https://github.com/davidbecker6081/ConnectME

#### Order Of Attack: 

#### MVP: I hope to have a multi-page application that brings in functionality of messaging and searching through friends. This application might also have the ability to store lists of friends in a particular city and user sign-in/sign-out functionality. 
Option: user can find one person and connect with and then choose a thing to do around that area or maybe have their info showing up on the map

#### Nice To Haves: Transitions/Animations, A dang good lookin' UI, Possibly yelp api (to find restaurants around area of friend)

#### Biggest Challenges: Creating a smooth flowing UI/UX. Implementing GoogleMaps API and actually taking user data to display on the map
