## Project Name: CitySnapshot (pending?)

#### Check In: 1

#### Project Pitch:
An app to generate cost of living data for different cities, and the ability to compare cost of living (including housing rates, rent scores, purchasing power, and salary comparison) across cities. The user can set their city, add individual cities to a list, and also add comparisons to a list to view later.

### Deliverables

#### Stack:
React, Router, Redux, might need node for backend.

#### APIs:
Teleport, Open Exchange, Numbeo

#### Wireframes

#### Order Of Attack
IT-1: Pull in city data, structure/build out city page with relevant drop-downs & checklists
IT-2: Build out search functionality for cities
IT-3: Comparison feature to compare two cities and their data
IT-4 (maybe extension): User sign-up/sign-in/sign-out capability; Ability to set a city for a user; Ability to save comparisons
Extensions:
Add moving checklist (prep, moving, settling in) with estimated moving cost
Ability to search by cost of living budget for a cities that match a range

#### MVP
An app that will let you search for a city's cost of living data, and also the ability to compare that city to another

#### Nice To Haves
See extensions

#### Biggest Challenges
User sign-up/sign-in/sign-out capability and implementing the backend for it
Testing

#### Instructor Notes

#### Deliverables for next checkin:

- have initial app set up
  - react redux router set up
  - have initial call to API made
  - Store should be updated with api data
  - Start building city page.
  - Start testing
