## Rubric

### Specification Adherence

* 3- - The application completes all 4 iterations.

### Code Quality

* 3 - Developer appears comfortable in React. There are minor opportunities to refactor.

### CSS/Design

* 2- - Developer has made intentional design decisions to create a user friendly application but Louisa would be mad. Attempts to follow 10 Essential Usability Guidelines.

### Testing

* 2- - A valid attempt was made to test functionality with obvious gaps where functionality is not tested

### PropType Implementation

* Pass - Proptype validation is implemented for any component receiving props.

### README Updates

* Fail - The boilerplate README is still in place

### Code Sanitation

The output from ESLint shows…

* 4 - Zero complaints

### Workflow

* 3- - Developer(s) make many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of the application but sometimes contain irrelevant changesets and inconsistent commit messages. Developer(s) use git branches and pull requests when applicable to incorporate changes into the application, and are not pushing fresh changes directly to master. Pull requests may contain little or no code review. There may be slight instances where the developer(s) have committed source code that should be .gitignored. There may be some instances of “dead” or commented-out code and debugger statements like console.log that need to be cleaned up.
