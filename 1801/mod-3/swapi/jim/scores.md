## Rubric

### Specification Adherence

* 1 - The application is missing multiple features essential to having a complete application.

### Code Quality

* 3 - Developer appears comfortable in React. There are minor opportunities to refactor.

### CSS/Design

* 1 - Developer did minimal to no CSS for this project besides what was indicated in the comp.

### Testing

* 2 - A valid attempt was made to test functionality with obvious gaps where functionality is not tested

### PropType Implementation

* Pass - Proptype validation is implemented for any component receiving props.

### README Updates

* Pass - The README.md file has been updated with a description of the project, the team, and how to get it up and
  running

### Code Sanitation

The output from ESLint shows…

* 4 - Zero complaints

### Workflow

* 4 - Developer(s) make many small, atomic commits that clearly document the evolution of the application and do not contain irrelevant changesets that aren’t reflected by the commit message. Commit messages are concise and consistent in syntax and tense. Developer(s) effectively use git branches and pull requests when applicable to incorporate changes into the application, and are not pushing directly to master. There are no instances where the developer(s) have committed source code that should be .gitignored. There are no instances of “dead” or commented-out code and debugger statements like console.log.
