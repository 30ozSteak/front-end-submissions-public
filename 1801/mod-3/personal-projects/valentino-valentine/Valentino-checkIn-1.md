#### Waffle & Github
[Asana](https://app.asana.com/0/685677221978308/board)

#### Order Of Attack: After creating my visual wireframe, I would love to have my data cleaned and handled for each food type
 Iteration 0 
  Basic file structure 
  Basic App Layout 
  Initial Fetch call
  Initial test
 Iteration 1
  Create calls/clean data for each food group
  Test
 Iteration 2 
  Add Rating functionality with upvote and downvote 
  Add History page 
 Iteration 3
  Sign in functionality 

#### MVP: Populating data the correct food types!  

#### Nice To Haves: Nutritional facts with each item 

#### Biggest Challenges: 
  Right now, looking at my data... Later on, I think I'll have issues with iteration 2 and using a backend server if necessary.

#### Instructor Notes

#### Deliverables for next checkin:
* Setup Redux and Router
* Nail down an api
* Make initial fetch request and put data into the store
* Add a linter
* Keep Asana up to date
* Start testing - test along the way
* Start building out the UI
* Store structure - flat and try not to duplicate data
