## Project Name: Picky Eater

#### Check In: after 1st checking

#### Progress made? Almost all agreed progress was made based on initial checkin.

All the wireframes - i.e. solid 5-8 pages - 4 pages done - A fairly complete mockup was made using figma.

React/Redux boilerplate - the store set up - Redux was added.

First API call from Zomato pulling data in to the app - Zomato API fetch was done.

Initial implementation of the 1st two wireframes - Yes

#### What deliverables still need to be completed from your last checkin?
I have a bug with the API call where it is always calling. I need to complete more pages.

#### Next Steps?
Fix the bug. Start doing TDD with my API calls.

#### What are your concerns (if any) - Testing.

#### Deliverables for next checkin:
- More api calls, getting back cuisines for a given city
- Page for narrowing down cuisines
- Page for narrowing down price range
- Listing of all restaurants based on input
- Make it all responsive
