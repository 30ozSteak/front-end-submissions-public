## Project Name:

#### Check In: 1

#### Progress made?
I added data from the EventBrite api, Yelp and Youtube apis;
The yelp api requiered the fetch call to be made from a server so I used AWS to build an api that fetches Yelp data;
I built my database and user authentication by using AWS, currently users can log in, sign up and log out;

#### What deliverables still need to be completed from your last checkin?
Display a single studio/ event or video 

#### Next Steps?
Implement location api to suggest cities 

#### What are your concerns (if any)
manage users and save posts to a database
