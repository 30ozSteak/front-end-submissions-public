## Project Name: First Trip

#### Check In - Number 1

#### Project Pitch:

### Since Colorado passed amendment 64 legalizing marijuana for recreational use in November of 2012, scores of citizens from around the country have come to this state to try out this product which has been illegal for nearly a century. First trip is a tool to help educate and inform users about all the laws and differenty ways they can enjoy marijuana. For many people the prospect of going into a dispensary and seeing so many different ways to consume this substance can been overwhelming. First trip helps the user by allowing them to select the kind of experience they are after and providing the user various strains that meet those criteria allowing for a great first trip out to Colorado.
