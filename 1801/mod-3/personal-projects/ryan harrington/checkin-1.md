#### Project Pitch
If you buy a house in Mexico, you don't Peso much.

Well in America, you pay a ton! Why? Take Denver for example where the average house costs $500k, on top of that you pay a plethora of fees, services, and not least of all your local billboard face realtor 6% of the sale price. $30k, you heard it right, within $5k of a starting teacher salary for the year. Bit of a cost-value discrepancy if you ask me.

30% of sellers attempt to sell their house FSBO, but only 8% actually follow through. At Secure FSBO, we offer the tools to make that 30% whole again. Our application provides a way of connecting buyers and sellers, who together don't want to throw $30k away.
