## Project Name:  first-ride

#### Check In: 2

#### Progress made?
Yes. I did a lot. 

#### What deliverables still need to be completed from your last checkin?
I need to add a linter and work more on my UI UX. 

#### Next Steps?
Signing up for rides is not possible yet... Work heavily on UI/UX. Build out the profile container and signout functionality. Also, signup. People should be able to delete rides from the database. 

#### What are your concerns (if any)
Haven't thought about how people will sign up yet... Theres a lot of interconnection going on. I will probably have to adjust the backend to accomodates a list of rides. 

#### Deliverables for next checkin:
