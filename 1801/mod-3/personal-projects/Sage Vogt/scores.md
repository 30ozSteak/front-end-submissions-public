### Project Scope

A good project idea should:

* Break down into logical iterations so that you can deliver a strong product on every check-in
* Be something that real people would want to use to solve a problem
* Have enough *technical* challenge to be worth your time (as opposed to a *content* challenge)

### Feature Delivery

* 4: Developer completed all the user stories and requirements set in check-ins in timely manner.

### CSS/Design

### Code Quality

- 3.5 - Developer appears comfortable in React. There are minor opportunities to refactor.

### Redux Architecture

### README Updates

  running

### Code Sanitation

* 3 - Five or fewer complaints

### Testing

- 3.5 - Almost all components are tested to a level that indicates developer has an understanding of testing

### Workflow

- 4 - Developer(s) make many small, atomic commits that clearly document the evolution of the application and do not contain irrelevant changesets that aren't reflected by the commit message. Commit messages are concise and consistent in syntax and tense. Developer effectively use git branches and pull requests when applicable to incorporate changes into the application, and are not pushing directly to master. There are no instances where the developer(s) have committed source code that should be .gitignored. There are no instances of "dead" or commented-out code and debugger statements like console.log.
