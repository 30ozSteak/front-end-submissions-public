## Project Name: FirstRide.

#### Check In: 3

#### Progress made?
MVP functionality is knocked out, UI/UX is much better. 

#### What deliverables still need to be completed from your last checkin?
I never used put/patch. I'll likely use a reverse geo code fetch call to grab the correct address for markers. 

#### Next Steps?
Add more functionality. Error handling.

#### What are your concerns (if any)
A lot more needs to be done

#### Deliverables for next checkin:
* Testing (no red)
* Tweak the UI
* Error handling
* Active status on nav links
* Extention - filter by date
* Remove ride after event has passed
* Prop Types
* Readme
* Linter
