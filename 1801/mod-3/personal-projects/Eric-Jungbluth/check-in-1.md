This site will allow users to post activities that they are going to participate in that they want/need other people to join them (basketball, frisbee golf, rock climbing, etc.). Activities will be tagged with a duration, location, and possibly activity tags. Users will then be able to search for either activities close to them, or search for activities by tag.
