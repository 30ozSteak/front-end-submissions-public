#### What deliverables still need to be completed from your last checkin?

MVP not quite finished. Testing is in a fairly good spot, but some left to do, then just general cleaning up of App flow and CSS. I think I've come up with a more natural flow for the App's use.

#### Next Steps?

To do still is add books to a book club (very simple with a few redux actions and a firebase database function), should only take about a half hour to get that done cleanly and to add a comment to a book club. I want to implement a WYSIWYG for this, and think with some digging around I can find a node package that will help with that setup. I anticipate only about two hours on this piece, then it's all testing and refining the app's flow. 

#### What are your concerns (if any)

Time! I know I can get it done easily, but I want it to be done well.
