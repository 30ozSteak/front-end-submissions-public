## Project Name: Read with me

#### Check In (what checkin number is this?)
1

#### Project Pitch
It's hard to make time. People have less and less availabilty for things these days, and with my application you can participate in a book club on your own time. Find free books, join public groups and join or create discussions about them.

### Deliverables
stack used, apis, check-in markdown and wireframes

#### Stack:

React, redux, router, Node.js, express and potentially firebase for the back end

#### APIs:

Goodreads, potentially others.

#### Wireframes

#### Waffle & Github

#### Order Of Attack

First order of business is to tackle the backend. Looking into lessons on Node.js, express and firebase I will set up my server first.

#### MVP

An application that lets you create book clubs for discussing them with your friends*

#### Nice To Haves

*Friends
Public Book Clubs
Free Book Resources

#### Biggest Challenges

Setting up the back end, feel comfortable with React, redux and router.

#### Instructor Notes

#### Deliverables for next checkin:

Have a roadmap of my MVP and some nice to haves, all in order of importance.

Have some sort of fetch call set up and working.

Able to start my app and see something, doesn't have to be much, just a non-crashing app. 

For myself I would like to have my back-end at least partially running. At this point undecided between firebase and using node.js and Express.
