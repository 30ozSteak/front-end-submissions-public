## Project Name: Another Book Club

#### Check In: 2

#### Progress made?

Not as much as I would have liked, but I still feel confident. Family was in town all weekend so most of my time was spent reading about and doing back-end tutorials with Node.js and Express. I feel pretty confident in my ability to get those working even if I have not set up a back end for my project.

Last night was my first real start but immediately hit a hiccup that I wasn't expecting. Most of the Goodreads API is in JSON, but the one endpoint I can use returns XML. I spent multiple hours last night trying everything I could to parse it into JSON or javascript to no avail. I did some more research this morning and think I could utilize the Google Books API for everything I need without OAuth, so I will set that up tonight.

My road map for myself and this project is as follows:
1. Set up google books API for searching for a book, (this is the extent of my API needs)
2. Set up back end for log in functionality first, then continue building it out as I need. 
3. Front end will have a splash page with some free book resources, as well as a search functionality (point 2)
4. Ability for users to create and join groups with the back end.

Each step must be fully tested before I move on.

#### What deliverables still need to be completed from your last checkin?

Actually everything we talked about was completed for this, but my API let me down :(

#### Next Steps?

Outlined in my roadmap above

#### What are your concerns (if any)

Just want to ensure that the google books API will do what I need it to.
