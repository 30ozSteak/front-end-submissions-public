#### Next Steps?
Continue TDD for add-to-menu feature  
Try to reuse RecipeCards in menu's Day container  
Add favorites toggle and filter feature  
Add groceryList component with items consolidation logic  

#### What are your concerns (if any)
creating the grocery list. pulling out the items from the ingredient strings plus aggregating the quantity. imagining it to be complex regex code with a large margin of error. (alternative would be to find an api that sets it up, and retrofit code)
plus same as before
