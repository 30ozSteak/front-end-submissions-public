## Project Name: the punchBowl

#### Check In: 1

#### Progress made?
I have all my data displaying on the page, and search functionality working.  

#### What deliverables still need to be completed from your last checkin?
I am unable to send fetched data to firebase.  I have been able to send mock data but, but for some reason am unablet to send fetched data.
I have not implemented router yet, but will be using router to send users to a login page so they can save news 'tracks'.
I need to fix my testing suite as well and write tests for everything I have written so far.
CSS needs to be updated as well.

#### Next Steps?

See above.

#### What are your concerns (if any)

Main concern right now is just getting the Firebase set up.  I feel confident in my ability to complete this project in its entirety.

#### Deliverables for next checkin:
