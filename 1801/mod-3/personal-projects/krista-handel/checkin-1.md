#### Waffle & Github
Github Issues

#### Order Of Attack
Iteration 0 -
Setup Firebase
Render search query to search results page
Iteration 1 -
Allow existing users to sign in/sign out
Allow users to create accounts
Iteration 2 -
User functionality: users able to (possibly) download pdfs and archive search results to personal dashboard

#### MVP
Would like to promote others to assist in making science open source by creating an easy to use web application, while helping others get the knowledge they desire.

#### Nice To Haves
Academic Knowledge API https://labs.cognitive.microsoft.com/en-us/project-academic-knowledge

#### Biggest Challenges
So far just using the API and checking whether or not the results are still available
