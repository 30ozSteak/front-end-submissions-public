## Project Name: Spotifive

#### Check In: 2

#### Progress made?

* Set up firebase (? - at least hosted at try-spotifive.firebaseapp.com)
* Set up Spotify dev account
* Basic app setup (npm start, npm test)
* Landing page w/'Signin with Spotify button'
* 'Signin with Spotify' redirects user to signin with their Spotify account
* If Signin is successful, Spotify redirects back to Authorization component
* Authorization component fetches user info and playlist info
* Playlist fetch checks to see if they have Spotifive playlist already (returning user)
* If no signin error, user is redirected to Search
* 56 tests :tada:
