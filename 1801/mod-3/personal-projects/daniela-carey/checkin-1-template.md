## Project Name: Spotifive

### Check In 1

#### Project Pitch

Imagine you're with your friends listening to music and your friend says, "If you like this song, you should check out this artist." In that moment, you don't have a chance to actually listen to your friend's recommended artist, but you want a way to remember them and queue the new music to listen to later. Spotifive allows you to quickly search for an artist and with one button, add that artist's top 5 songs to a Spotifive playlist in your own Spotify account. Queue up new music recommendations now to listen to later.
