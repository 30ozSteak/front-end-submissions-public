## Project Name:SPORTSBALL

#### Check In: 2

#### Progress made?
- Was able to get api calls fetching correct data. 
- Storing data in redux store.
- Made a high fidelity mockup.
- Made UI and styling for a few components.
- Started testing api calls.

#### What deliverables still need to be completed from your last checkin?
Setting up firebase. The more I think about it the more I think I might not need it.

#### Next Steps?
- I want to get more testing done. 
- Get things populating on the page. 
- Start writing up numberous cliche sports phrases to populate fields. 
- Style main page. 
- Maybe get firebase setup?

#### What are your concerns (if any)
Not really sure how I'm going to make certain words hoverable to reveal their definition.

#### Deliverables for next checkin:
- Get rid of sign up... dont need user to sign in
- Continue testing
- Populate data on the page
- If you are going to get all the data on page load, you need to have some check that the data is current

- Look into showing definitions on hover
- Look into refactoring so that you are not making so many fetch calls on page load
