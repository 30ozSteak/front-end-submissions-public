## Project Name: 
Clinical Trials

#### Check In: 1

#### Progress made?
I have setup my react redux boiler plate, and have my store updating when I fetch.  My fetch is working dynamically based on search input.

#### What deliverables still need to be completed from your last checkin?
1.  wireframe for logged in user.

#### Next Steps?
Get all of my tests running.  
Create forms for logIn and signUp.
Add filter for location of searchData.
Understand Firebase and determine what a logged in user will see.

#### What are your concerns (if any)
I am not sure what is valuable information in regard tmedical studies. I have never used firebase before

#### Deliverables for next checkin:
- Loading indicator on search
- Clicking on a given trial should show me more information
- Authenticate with firebase
- Saving of trial ids in firebase
