# Code Quality

#### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub that you are proud of
[happy code](https://github.com/hdechat/byob-volcanoes/blob/77c8a4c227aa96a228031afb4366d9bb3d9cc36a/test/routes.spec.js#L189-L225)

* Why were you proud of this piece of code?  
We were proud of this code because we struggled with testing some endpoints other than `GET` endpoints due to certain information being different each time. We were able to figure out how to avoid this issue by rolling back our seeded data in the beforeEach hook.

#### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub that you feel not great about
[sad code](https://github.com/hdechat/byob-volcanoes/blob/77c8a4c227aa96a228031afb4366d9bb3d9cc36a/server.js#L215-L231)

* Why do you feel not awesome about the code? What challenges did you face trying to write/refactor it?  
We were certain that there was a better way to check the requested keys against the data stored in the database. We did not have time to refactor this.
