## Completion

#### Were you able to complete the base functionality?

Yes

#### Which extensions, if any, did you complete?

# Code Quality

#### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub that you are proud of
[happy code](https://github.com/YayFiber/palette-picker/blob/535332b1259ff93a15f34d4ef5637d5807300252/server.js#L84-L98)

I just was happy to find a way to discover that an id was invalid that seems clean. I'm sure there are other ways to handle it, but this seemed good to me!

#### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub that you feel not great about
[sad code](https://github.com/YayFiber/palette-picker/blob/535332b1259ff93a15f34d4ef5637d5807300252/public/js/scripts.js#L161-L177)

I think there's probably just a cleaner way to append a palette to my projects, not because the code is inherently sloppy, although it's not exactly eloquent, but because it made finding information through the DOM a little more difficult than I would have liked.

#### Attach a screenshot or paste the output from your terminal of the result of your test-suite running.

#### Link to Design Inspiration

Coolers was clearly the UI inspiration, and I stole the font from my own site, because it's GROOVY, but the bottom part I stayed close to spec!
