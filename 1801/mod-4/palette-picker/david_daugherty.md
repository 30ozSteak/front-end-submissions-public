## Completion

#### Were you able to complete the base functionality?

I was able to get most of it done. I believe the only thing missing was the selecting of the palette to display up top and testing. The reason I did'nt finish was purely time. I was extremely busy with other things this week that made it hard to multitask and devote to necessary amount of time for it.

#### Which extensions, if any, did you complete?

N/A

# Code Quality

#### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub that you are proud of
[happy code](https://github.com/daughedm/palette-picker/blob/134ebe48e03aaae5d02e7fe0d1f4789e9ce040dd/public/js/scripts.js#L22)

* Why were you proud of this piece of code?
It's not the best and could be refractored but I'm just proud of it because it was the first time I had to reremember how to use jquery since mod 1. It just made me reflect a bit about where I've come in the past 6 months.

#### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub that you feel not great about
[sad code](https://github.com/daughedm/palette-picker/blob/134ebe48e03aaae5d02e7fe0d1f4789e9ce040dd/public/js/scripts.js#L50)

* Why do you feel not awesome about the code? What challenges did you face trying to write/refactor it?

The populateProjectsPalettes I feel is kinda hacky but it works. I feel if I had more time I would have broke it out into multiple functions.  


#### Attach a screenshot or paste the output from your terminal of the result of your test-suite running.

#### Link to Design Inspiration

* Show us what you used as design inspiration (another color picker site, a dribbble UI element, a user flow, etc.) and explain what you stole from it

[dribbble](https://dribbble.com/shots/3735505-Clean-interface)

I am a sucker for really clean minimalistic design so from this I took away that I wanted the colors to be front and center with very minimal things around it to skew what the colors true hues are.

#### Please feel free to ask any other questions or make any other statements below!

Anything else you wanna say!
This was probably one of the hardest weeks at turing for me. Coming off a 2 week break then going straight into learning about express, sql, node, server testing while also having to relearn jquery and having to stress over demo night and applying for jobs was pretty tough for me. I've come to realize that multitasking is not my greatest strength. I plan On working on this over the weekend to get my testing up and running as well as commenting my server file.
