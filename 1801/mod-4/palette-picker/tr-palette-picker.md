# Code Quality

#### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub that you are proud of
[happy code](https://github.com/tonyr729/palette-picker/blob/a6e200594435797eeab77944c45860ab21caefb5/public/js/scripts.js#L6)

* Why were you proud of this piece of code?

Theres several areas of the code I feel happy about. Selecting this snippet because it was the first code I made and thought 
the solution to make the color hex values randomly and apply them was elegant.

#### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub that you feel not great about
[sad code](https://github.com/tonyr729/palette-picker/blob/a6e200594435797eeab77944c45860ab21caefb5/public/js/scripts.js#L94)

* Why do you feel not awesome about the code? What challenges did you face trying to write/refactor it?
This code is not case insensitive. For some reason I spent in inornate amount of time trying to make the input values toUppercase
but was unsucessful and had to move on with the rest of the project.

I have added a github issues to addess it later.

Anything else you wanna say!

Fun project. Wish I had more time but overall it was fun.

I couldn't get past the errors I had with testing. Still fuzzy and implementing knex for the before/beforeEach.

I coded out what I thought my tests should be and skipped them. I also have a github issues to fix testing.
