# Code Quality

#### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub that you are proud of
[happy code](https://github.com/hdechat/Palette-Picker/blob/11891d46ff02625219b5fa9b9e25a4decf21b7c3/public/js/scripts.js#L52-L63)

* Why were you proud of this piece of code?
 I have the most fun with these type of puzzles. I like that it works and it's easy to understand.

#### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub that you feel not great about
[sad code](https://github.com/hdechat/Palette-Picker/blob/5df5dcb506875d3f674bf98877c205848dd45db5/test/routes.spec.js#L192-L270)

* Why do you feel not awesome about the code? What challenges did you face trying to write/refactor it?
It's commented out sadly. I ran out of time trying to solve the puzzle of testing dynamic id params that are generated with the increments method that keep changing with each seed run. I thought I had a clever solution until I realized that for some reason they were just passing indiscriminantly.

#### Attach a screenshot or paste the output from your terminal of the result of your test-suite running.

#### Link to Design Inspiration

* Show us what you used as design inspiration (another color picker site, a dribbble UI element, a user flow, etc.) and explain what you stole from it

I liked the gradient background, and used that in a different shade. I was happy to find this site to keep it super easy!

#### Please feel free to ask any other questions or make any other statements below!

Anything else you wanna say!  
I'm pretty happy with my functionality. I would have liked to have had more time to redo the UI for adding a saved palette to a saved project. User can save  palettes independently of projects. To save a palette to a project, user must click onto the palette, then onto the project name, and finally onto the save to project button. I didn't have enough time to create more visual indications of what's going on. But I am happy that there is an alert pop up that prevents the user from deleting a palette from the Palettes column if it is included in a project. Needs lots of CSS tlc, but it works :D
