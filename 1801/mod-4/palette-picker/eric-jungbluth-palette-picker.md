## Completion

#### Were you able to complete the base functionality?

Although a little buggy, it does have all of the base functionality. Wait, I was just reminded that you are supposed to be able to click on the palette under its project name and have the main palette change to those colors. I forgot about that, so it definitely doesn't have that bit of functionality. Oops!

#### Which extensions, if any, did you complete?

Hahaha!

# Code Quality

#### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub that you are proud of
[happy code](https://github.com/EricMellow/palette-picker/blob/702039f859b4403f18f3c6f85a85545c6c32a024/server.js#L114-L128)

* I liked that I was able to implement the dynamic route feature to get all of the palettes from a specific project. I did this late in the project, and wish I had put more of my logic in the server.

#### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub that you feel not great about
[sad code](https://github.com/EricMellow/palette-picker/blob/702039f859b4403f18f3c6f85a85545c6c32a024/public/js/scripts.js#L164-L207)

*This is ugly and there's another function that kind of has some similar functionality, so I don't feel good about that. Definitely doesn't feel like DRY code. Refactor?! HA! I definitely didn't have time refactor.

#### Attach a screenshot or paste the output from your terminal of the result of your test-suite running.

#### Link to Design Inspiration

* I scrolled through dribble a bit, but it was kind of overwhelming and I didn't really find anything useful. Honestly, I never got to a place during this project where I had time to go look for design inspiration.

#### Please feel free to ask any other questions or make any other statements below!

I'm sleepy!
