## Completion

#### Were you able to complete the base functionality?

I believe I have most of the functionality. The only thing I am aware of is on the display
of the palettes I don't have the project name. PS The delete works but I need to update the
DOM when you delete until the next page reload.

#### Which extensions, if any, did you complete?

haha

[sad code]()

* Why do you feel not awesome about the code? What challenges did you face trying to write/refactor it?

I have always thought that doing server code was the last step to becoming a full stack developer.
