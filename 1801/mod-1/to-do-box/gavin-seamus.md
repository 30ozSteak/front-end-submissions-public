## Notes/What To Work On:

## Functional Expectations
* Advanced Beginner  
partial phase 3 - nothing past importance

## HTML

#### Accessibility
* Advanced Beginner  

aria-label, maybe use describedby for long text
aria-live would probably make more sense on the list where you are adding the todos

#### Style
* Advanced Beginner  
watch out for elements w single child

## CSS

#### Structure of Code
* Advanced Beginner  
Have a strategy for organizing your css properties. Alphabetical is an easy way to get started.

#### Implementation
* Proficient  


## JAVASCRIPT

#### Data Types
* Proficient  

#### Conditional Logic
* Proficient  

#### Functions & Scope
* Advanced Beginner  

Do not invoke a function when passing it in as a parameter, i.e. `$(document).ready(persistUserData());`

#### Arrays
* Advanced Beginner  

Try using a forEach in the future when looping over an array

#### Objects & Prototypes
* Advanced Beginner  
Try to create a prototype function to generate the html

Great constructor function, however you never actually pass in an id, title, body, quality or completed, so you might as well just default all of those values

#### DOM Manipulation

* Proficient  

#### Style
* Advanced Beginner  
upVote and downVote share a lot of functionality, the only thing different is how the next quality is decided, you could move that out into two seperate functions and combine the rest.

editTitleContent and editBodyContent are almost the same, you could use a conditional statement to determine if the title or body should be assigned a value.

good job refactoring the search into one function that could take any selector.
