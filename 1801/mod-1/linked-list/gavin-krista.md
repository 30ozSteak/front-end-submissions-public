## Student: Gavin and Krista
## Evaluator: David Whitaker
## Notes/What To Work On:

- Sounds like it was a great learning experience on both sides
- Learned a lot about pairing
- Git workflow and learning suffered due to pairing

### comp

- Some issues with responsiveness
- Leverage containers more

### html

- Some issues with nesting
- Keep accessibility in mind

### css

- Consider organizing based on components on the page
- set base font weight for the page and override where necessary
- Consider adding organizational comments
- break out duplicate lines into more broad selectors (ie. card-button class)

### js

- Break template literals onto multiple lines and format like you would in html file
- no need for $.on load when script is at bottom of body
- never nest event listeners
- naming conventions could use work (think in terms of actions)

### git and github

- Would like to see more commits and commits more often
- 50 commits would be good for a project of this magnitude
