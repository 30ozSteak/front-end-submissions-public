## Student: Kylee and Cameron
## Evaluator: David Whitaker
## Notes/What To Work On:

### comp

- Really solid recreation

### html

- Wonderful organization
- Great strides toward accessibility
- default to using classes over ids

### css

- set base font weight on everything and override where necessary
- consider using bem
- consider organizational comments
- break duplicate lines of code into a more broad selector and override where necessary (ie. card-buttons class)

### js

- naming conventions could use work (think in terms of actions)
- really clean

### git and github

- Would like to see more commits and commits more often
- 50 commits would be good for a project of this magnitude
