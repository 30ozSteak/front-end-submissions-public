## Student: Daniela & Tyler
## Evaluator: David Whitaker
## Notes/What To Work On:

### html

- nice work using aria labels
- great naming conventions
- default to using classes instead of ids for reusability

### css

- 0 not 0px
- consider adding organizational comments for each page component
- consider using bem (takes away from the cognitive load of naming things)
- default to classes instead of ids and comma separated selectors
- consider loading only one style sheet in the head and import all others

### js

- No need for most comments
- Try leveraging parameters and arguments in place of global variables
- Think in terms of Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) - each function name should say exactly what the function does.

### git/github
- loved seeing 50 commits 
- say a little more
