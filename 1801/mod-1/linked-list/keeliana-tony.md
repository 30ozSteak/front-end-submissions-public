## Student: Keeliana and Tony
## Evaluator: David
## Notes/What To Work On:

### html

- use forms!!!!!!
- use aria labels

### css

- consider organizing based on components in the page
- consider organizational comments
- bem should be more componentized based on functionality
  - `form` is my block, then I can have `form__input` as an element class and override with a modifier where necessary
- Pull duplicate declarations into more broad selector rules and override where necessary

### js

- work on naming things - say more, action like names
- Think in terms of Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) - each function name should say exactly what the function does.

### git/github

- Would like to see more commits and commits more often
- 50 commits would be good for a project of this magnitude
