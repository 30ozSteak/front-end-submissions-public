## Student: Jim & David
## Evaluator: Pamela Lovett
## Notes/What To Work On:

## General
- Through all 4 phases!
- Thank you for bringing your notebooks and taking notes for the verbal feedback during eval - keep it up
- GREAT job with the rickroll!!

## Design/comp recreation
- Good comp recreation overall - holds up well across all screen sizes
- Always be sure to ask clarifying questions for anything on the spec that is vague or unclear
- YAY for favicons! It's the little things

## HTML
- Good job using semantic HTML
- Inputs should have forms
- Add labels for inputs, and lang attribute
- Run through screenreader after done

## Git/GitHub
- Cleaned up old/finished branches
- Used waffle - hooray!
- Good, descriptive commits that follow conventions

## CSS
- Nice job alphabetizing declarations
- Look into organizing your declarations [idiomatically](https://github.com/necolas/idiomatic-css) for the next project
- Do not remove the outline (line 10) without providing alternative styling or accounting for users who depend on the keyboard as their primary way of navigation. See [this article](https://medium.com/@matuzo/writing-css-with-accessibility-in-mind-8514a0007939) on writing accessible CSS and [this link within said article](http://www.outlinenone.com/)for alternative styling options. [This article](https://hackernoon.com/removing-that-ugly-focus-ring-and-keeping-it-too-6c8727fefcd2) also has some alternatives to use to get rid of the focus while still keeping things accessible

## JS
- Nice job talking through your code. Continue to practice this with your project partners/rubber ducks
- No need to assign selected elements to vars in 28/29. Just select the elements and grab the values all in lines 30/31
- Nice touch bringing focus back to input on 62
- Very easy to read and follow throughout
