## Student: Laura & Steph
## Evaluator: Pamela Lovett
## Notes/What To Work On:

## General
- Through all 4 phases with some bugs: read button does not toggle red, URL validation buggy, hover still works on disabled button

## Design/Comp recraetion
- Comp looks pretty good overall - minor polishing needed throughout
- Icons/counter need more breathing room

## Git/GitHub
- Good number of commits
- Be more descriptive in commits
- Name branches based on features

## HTML
- Nice job using semantic HTML
- Add labels, and lang to HTML
- Run through screenreader to check accessibility

## CSS
- Avoid the use of IDs as CSS selectors to avoid specificity issues when your codebase grows
- Reference the [CSS Style Guide](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/css) for proper spacing/formatting (Should have a space between selector and opening curly brace)
- Alternative to organizing your CSS rules using SMACSS [here](https://smacss.com/book/categorizing)
- 1 media query!

## JS
- Nice job doing 99.99% of this in vanilla js!
- Nice find with `document.forms`
- Created all elements/classes/content via JS methods - impressive
- Opportunites for refactoring functionality that creates cards - breaking apart the actual functionality based on what is being created (e.g., a function called `createURL` that does all things related to the URL - including creating the element, adding the class, and displaying it's content. Then doing that for each piece of the card that is being created)
