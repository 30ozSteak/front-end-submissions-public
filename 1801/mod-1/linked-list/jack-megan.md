## Student: Jack & Megan
## Evaluator: Pamela Lovett
## Notes/What To Work On:

## General 
- Through Phase 4 with some bugs
- Clear read bookmarks button not wokring
- Thank you for bringing your notebooks and taking notes for the verbal feedback during eval - keep it up
- Nice job with README

## Design/comp recreation
- Love the addition of the favicon to the link!
- Very clean layout overall - some minor polishing needed
- Find work around for inputs popping out of place due to error messaging

## Git/GitHub
- Would like to see more commits
- Good start with being descriptive on commits - be sure to write meaningful descriptions that are still concise
- Good job following conventions for commit messages

## HTML
- Great job with accessibility throughout
- Use `aria-label` attribute on input instead of label element (with for/id linking) if there is nothing to display on the screen
- Remove spacing between lines. Limit characters on one line to less than 80 - sme parts are hard to read
- Be sure to run through a screenreader next time

## CSS
- 3 media queries 
- Nice job alphabetizing declarations
- Look into organizing your declarations [idiomatically](https://github.com/necolas/idiomatic-css) for the next project

## JS
- Nice touch bringing focus back to input on 49
- Good job with speaking to your code
- Code is really easy to follow/read
- Opportunities for refactoring with `makeCard` function
