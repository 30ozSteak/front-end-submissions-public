## Student: Angela & Stephanie
## Evaluator: Nathaniel
## Notes/What To Work On:

## Functional Expectations

* Proficient  The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by jQuery. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals.
- Does not save when quality changes

## HTML

## Accessibility
* Novice  Knows what a semantic tag is and leverages the HTML5 structural tags to organize the content of their markup.
- No alt tags for img elements

## Style
* Advanced Beginner Crafts markup with proper and logical nesting.
- Poor Indentation

## CSS

## Structure of Code

* Advanced Beginner Can cleanly and logically organize CSS rules according to similar categories (i.e. typography, layout, components), and then logically organize the remaining CSS rules based on flow of the markup. Organizes properties within rules alphabetically.

## Implementation
* Proficient  Develops layouts that work cross-browser, are responsive, and can logically defend the choices made in implementation approach for layout.

## JAVASCRIPT

## Data Types

* Proficient  Can identify and track data types through any variety of functions, understanding their affect and result on each line of code. Knows which scenarios are better suited for objects vs. arrays and employs them accordingly.

## Conditional Logic

* Proficient  Can use an if/esle statement to effectively handle multiple paths through the code. Writes if/else statements that only have one level of logic (no nesting). Can use logical operators instead of if/else statements where applicable.

## Functions & Scope

* Advanced Beginner Developer is comfortable using multiple arguments to pass data into functions. Understands how variables are scoped at the function level and global level. Functions are named descriptively. Knows when and why to use return in a function.
- no variable declarations in for loops or if statements

## Arrays

* Advanced Beginner Can modify arrays by adding or removing specific elements - uses array methods such as push or shift. Can use a for loop to iterate through array.
- Use array prototype iterator methods

## Objects & Prototypes

* Novice  Can declare an object literal and define/articulate properties vs. methods for an object. Can extract values of an object’s property, and assign new properties and/or reassign values of existing properties on an object.
- Use object constructor functions

DOM Manipulation

* Advanced Beginner Can add event listeners and create small functions that execute on events, can leverage the event object appropriately, and can articulate the what/why/how of jQuery.
- be consistent with event listeners

Style

* Advanced Beginner Code shows strong effort toward organization, but suffers from long functions, unnecessary or poorly named variables, and requires significant refactoring. Application may have some duplication and minor bugs.
- Create saveToLocalstorage function
- Use better names for functions (use verbs)
- Indent code properly


## GIT & GITHUB

## Git

* Advanced Beginner Can create branches and willingly attempts to incorporate branches into their workflow. Commits, while infrequent, are increased in volume and show improvements in description.

Github

* Advanced Beginner Can execute basic pull requests with context about changes in description. Can keep local and GitHub repositories in sync.


## DESIGN

## Comp Recreation

* Proficient  Developer captures the spirit and design intent of the comp. Some small details need polish to achieve a pixel-perfect match to the comp, but developer is clearly mindful of details and has made a conscious and careful effort to match the comp. Any design decisions left open to interpretation are handled thoughtfully and are well executed, but are more noticeable and/or unintuitive than they would be if the designer had provided the solution, or may not be totally seamless during screen-size transitions.


## PAIRING

## Collaboration

* Proficient  Can diplomatically handle issues that arise between the pair through respectful, focused, targeted feedback and implement changes to positively adapt the working relationship and keep the project on track. Can effectively implement tactics to support their partner’s learning and project goals, while also honoring their own personal learning and project goals, should the two be different or at different levels due to skill delta.
