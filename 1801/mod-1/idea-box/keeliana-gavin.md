## Student: Keeliana & Gavin
## Evaluator: Pamela Lovett
## Notes/What To Work On:

## General
- Not convinced the pairing went well based on your body language and interactions with one another. Be sure to do a DTR everytime that you start a new project 
- Application does not save quality and also creates blanks cards
- Quality buttons, edit text not working. No search functionality

## Design/Comp Recreation
- Overall, comp recreation is pretty good. Becomes stretched on larger screens. Be sure to use a max-width on containers that need to be restricted
- Little bit of weirdness on mobile with cards, buttons pushed over, margin around the body

## GitHub
- 13 commits - would like to see more
- Be sure to clone and not fork repo when working on paired projects
- Be sure to follow the conventions for commiting and make clear, concise commits often

## HTML

- Add meta tag for responsiveness
- Add labels to inputs, lang attribute to html
- Good job using semantic tags

## CSS

- General selectors are at the top. Consider using [SMACCS](https://smacss.com/book/categorizing) for organizing rules
- Make sure there is an empty line between selectors. Indentation off. Follow the [CSS Style guide](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/css)
- Use shorthand whenever possible
- Organize CSS declaration alphabetically or [idiotmatically](https://github.com/necolas/idiomatic-css)

## JS

- Nice job used a constructor for data 
- Continue to practice talking through code
- Good naming
- Add `var` for declared variables (line 62)
- No need for `else if` for logic in line 75 and 90. Should juse be `else` with two levels in this instance

## Functional Expectations

* Novice  Application meets all of the basic functional expectations of create, edit, delete, persist in local storage.

## HTML

## Accessibility

* Advanced Beginner Leverages more precise semantic tags when applicable, and employs basic ARIA roles attributes for added clarity in structure, descriptive image alt attributes, title attributes for applicable anchor tags.

## Style

* Advanced Beginner Crafts markup with proper and logical nesting.
* Proficient  Crafts lean, efficient markup that is easy to read and follow across naming conventions, structure, and solid formatting that follows industry best practices.

## CSS

## Structure of Code

* Novice  Can effectively target DOM elements via tag, class, and/or id and write CSS rules around each element to create the desired style.
* Advanced Beginner Can cleanly and logically organize CSS rules according to similar categories (i.e. typography, layout, components), and then logically organize the remaining CSS rules based on flow of the markup. Organizes properties within rules alphabetically.

## Implementation

* Advanced Beginner Can articulate the differences between the approaches of absolute/relative positioning, flex-box, floats, and can appropriately apply the approaches to solve a variety of layout problems.

## JAVASCRIPT

## Data Types

* Proficient  Can identify and track data types through any variety of functions, understanding their affect and result on each line of code. Knows which scenarios are better suited for objects vs. arrays and employs them accordingly.

## Conditional Logic

* Advanced Beginner Uses if/else statements, but there are multiple levels of nesting, which makes the paths through the code difficult to follow. Understands what is “truthy” and “falsey” in JavaScript.

## Functions & Scope

* Proficient  Functions have single responsibility. The entirety of the function is easy to read what functionality it contains. Function is generally shorter than 8 lines. Uses functions to eliminate repeated code. Comfortable refactoring any piece of code and extracting it to a function.

## Arrays

* Advanced Beginner Can modify arrays by adding or removing specific elements - uses array methods such as push or shift. Can use a for loop to iterate through array.

## Objects & Prototypes

* Advanced Beginner Can use object constructor functions and is comfortable with extracting values of properties on different object instances.

## DOM Manipulation

* Proficient  Able to extract information, modify attributes, or append/prepend data in the DOM easily regardless of whether they are employing vanilla JavaScript or jQuery. Understands how to harness event bubbling.

## Style

* Advanced Beginner Code shows strong effort toward organization, but suffers from long functions, unnecessary or poorly named variables, and requires significant refactoring. Application may have some duplication and minor bugs.
* Proficient  Code is logically organized, such that reader can easily follow the progression of the app because variable and function names are descriptive and follow a single responsibility approach. There are no major bugs and minimal duplication.

## GIT & GITHUB

## Git

* Advanced Beginner Can create branches and willingly attempts to incorporate branches into their workflow. Commits, while infrequent, are increased in volume and show improvements in description.

## GitHub

* Advanced Beginner Can execute basic pull requests with context about changes in description. Can keep local and GitHub repositories in sync.

## DESIGN

## Comp Recreation

* Advanced Beginner Can accomplish about 50-75% of the large and small design details and can logically rework them on at least 1 breakpoint.
* Proficient  Developer captures the spirit and design intent of the comp. Some small details need polish to achieve a pixel-perfect match to the comp, but developer is clearly mindful of details and has made a conscious and careful effort to match the comp. Any design decisions left open to interpretation are handled thoughtfully and are well executed, but are more noticeable and/or unintuitive than they would be if the designer had provided the solution, or may not be totally seamless during screen-size transitions.


## PAIRING

## Collaboration

* Novice  Can communicate needs, expectations, scheduling constraints through a DTR, effectively creating a working plan with partner.
