## Student: Cameron & Tyler
## Evaluator: Pamela Lovett
## Notes/What To Work On:

## General
- All the way through the phases, no extensions
- Sounds like things went well. Be sure to do a DTR every time

## Design/Comp recreation
- Accounts for longer text
- Near pixel perfect. Header could be a bit smaller on mobile - but overall, really good

## Git/GitHub
- 16 commits - would like to see more
- Make sure that you are not merging your own PRs 
- Really good commit messages and explanations for what is being worked on
- If you choose to delete branches after being merged, make sure to stay consistent and delete them allMake sure that you delete all the branches that you are working of 

## HTML
- Add form around your input for search
- Nice job incorporating `aria-label` and `aria-required`
- Ran through a screenreader!

## CSS
- Alphabetized declarations - also look into organizing your declarations [idiomatically](https://github.com/necolas/idiomatic-css)
- Make sure there is an empty line between selectors
- Good responsiveness for various screen sizes with only one media query!

## JS

- Did not follow the specs for Data Model as defined in the spec
- Strange to be storing HTML in localStorage (line 50) instead of just the data that you need. Not sure how I feel about you overwriting local storage every time
- Lines 8 and 11 are redundant - both clearing inputs
- Nice job incorporating aria/being mindful of accessibility on HTML template in 
`prependIdea`
- Really good naming conventions - easy to follow
- Good job talking through code
- Opportunities for refactoring `editTitleText` and `editTitleBody` into one function 

## Functional Expectations

* Proficient  The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by jQuery. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals.

## HTML

## Accessibility

* Proficient  Employs detailed accessibility practices throughout markup, especially in forms and can speak to decisions made in accessibility choices as it relates to specific accessibility concerns.
* Exceptional Can run markup through a variety of online accessibility tools and score well for content, color, screen readers, etc.

## Style

* Proficient  Crafts lean, efficient markup that is easy to read and follow across naming conventions, structure, and solid formatting that follows industry best practices.

## CSS

## Structure of Code

* Advanced Beginner Can cleanly and logically organize CSS rules according to similar categories (i.e. typography, layout, components), and then logically organize the remaining CSS rules based on flow of the markup. Organizes properties within rules alphabetically.
* Proficient  Leverages cascading styles and CSS specificity rules to create more complex targeting of elements in order to reduce, reuse, share styles across elements. Organizes properties within rules based upon industry standard principles of writing consistent, idiomatic CSS.

## Implementation

* Proficient  Develops layouts that work cross-browser, are responsive, and can logically defend the choices made in implementation approach for layout.

## JAVASCRIPT

## Data Types

* Proficient  Can identify and track data types through any variety of functions, understanding their affect and result on each line of code. Knows which scenarios are better suited for objects vs. arrays and employs them accordingly.


## Conditional Logic

* Proficient  Can use an if/esle statement to effectively handle multiple paths through the code. Writes if/else statements that only have one level of logic (no nesting). Can use logical operators instead of if/else statements where applicable.

## Functions & Scope

* Proficient  Functions have single responsibility. The entirety of the function is easy to read what functionality it contains. Function is generally shorter than 8 lines. Uses functions to eliminate repeated code. Comfortable refactoring any piece of code and extracting it to a function.

## Arrays

* Novice  Can create array and use array indexing to extract data from array or modify array. Comfortable using arrays to store simple data types: numbers, booleans, or strings.

## Objects & Prototypes

* Novice  Can declare an object literal and define/articulate properties vs. methods for an object. Can extract values of an object’s property, and assign new properties and/or reassign values of existing properties on an object.

## DOM Manipulation

* Proficient  Able to extract information, modify attributes, or append/prepend data in the DOM easily regardless of whether they are employing vanilla JavaScript or jQuery. Understands how to harness event bubbling.

## Style

* Proficient  Code is logically organized, such that reader can easily follow the progression of the app because variable and function names are descriptive and follow a single responsibility approach. There are no major bugs and minimal duplication.

## GIT & GITHUB

## Git

* Advanced Beginner Can create branches and willingly attempts to incorporate branches into their workflow. Commits, while infrequent, are increased in volume and show improvements in description.


## GitHub

* Advanced Beginner Can execute basic pull requests with context about changes in description. Can keep local and GitHub repositories in sync.

## DESIGN

## Comp Recreation

* Exceptional Developer skillfully captures the spirit and design intent of all comp details. Execution is pixel-perfect and any design decisions left open to interpretation are solved intentionally, are as seamless as if the designer had provided the solution, are handled gracefully, and enhance the overall design.


## PAIRING

## Collaboration

* Proficient  Can diplomatically handle issues that arise between the pair through respectful, focused, targeted feedback and implement changes to positively adapt the working relationship and keep the project on track. Can effectively implement tactics to support their partner’s learning and project goals, while also honoring their own personal learning and project goals, should the two be different or at different levels due to skill delta.
