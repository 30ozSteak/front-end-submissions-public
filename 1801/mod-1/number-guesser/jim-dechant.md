## Notes/What To Work On:

- Great job organizing your plan of attack with a checklist!
- Made it through Phase 4
- NYAN CAT!!! AMAZING

- Continue to push forward with accessibility - semantic HTML, 
- Use the `aria-label` attribute instead of the tag for label if you are not looking to dispay a label for your input

- Nice organization of CSS rules.
- Look into organizing your declarations[idiomatically](https://github.com/necolas/idiomatic-css) for your next project

- Remove commented out code, broken code, console logs
- Nice job with naming
- Could use named functions for event listeners/drying up code
