## Student: Keeliana Marler
## Evaluator: Pamela Lovett
## Notes/What To Work On:

- All the way through Phase 1 - started phase 2

- Good spacing in HTML. Watch indentation for nested elements
- Good use of semantic HTML - continue to push forward with accessibility (labels on inputs)

- Reference [CSS style guide](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/css) for proper spacing
- Be sure to organize your [CSS rules](https://smacss.com/book/categorizing)
- Organize your declarations alphabetically or [idiomatically](https://github.com/necolas/idiomatic-css)

- Reference [JS style guide](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/javascript/tree/master/es5) for clean up/organization of file
- Great job with starting to break functionality apart!
- Continue to work on talking through your code... with a partner, yourself, or a rubber duck
