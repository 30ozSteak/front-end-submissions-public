## Student: Jack Laird
## Evaluator: Pamela Lovett
## Notes/What To Work On:

- Completed Phase 2 and 1/2 of phase 3
- Good recreation of the comp - opportunities for polishing/tighetning up

- Remove spacing from HTML file
- Push forward with accessibity - continue using semantic tags.. Add `aria-label` for inputs where you don't want labels displayed to user
- Avoid adding divs as wrappers for structural layouts - should only be used as a last resort

- Reference [CSS style guide](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/css) for proper spacing/indentation
- Be sure to organize your [CSS rules](https://smacss.com/book/categorizing)
- Organize your declarations alphabetically or [idiomatically](https://github.com/necolas/idiomatic-css)

- Good start with JS - opportunities for refactoring/DRYing up
- Work on naming
