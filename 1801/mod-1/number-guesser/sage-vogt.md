## Notes/What To Work On:

### comp

- good job sticking to container
- could have default min and max numbers

### html

- use aria-label
- semantics ie. sections, articles instead of divs

### css

- organize based on components
- pull out duplicate blocks into more broad classes ie. button that applies main button styles and override colors where necessary

### js

- nice job using that for loop
- pull out duplicate lines into functions
