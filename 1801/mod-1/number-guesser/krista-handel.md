## Notes/What To Work On:

- All the way through phase 2 - parts of phase 3
- Nice job using a checklist for organization

- Be sure to organize your [CSS rules](https://smacss.com/book/categorizing)
- Organize your declarations alphabetically or [idiomatically](https://github.com/necolas/idiomatic-css)

- Remove commented out code that isn't working
- Good start for JS - some opportunities for refactoring longer functions
