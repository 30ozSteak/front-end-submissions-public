## Notes/What To Work On:

- Made it through Phase 2

- Get rid of spaces in HTML. Nice job with indentation on nested elements

- Be sure to organize your [CSS rules](https://smacss.com/book/categorizing)
- Organize your declarations alphabetically or [idiomatically](https://github.com/necolas/idiomatic-css)

- Nice job talking about your JS. Continue to practice with partners, yourself, or a rubber duck
- Opportunities for refactoring - redundant lines of code/breaking out functionality
