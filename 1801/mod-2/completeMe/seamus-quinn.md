### Comments:
* not a huge fan of the `notNull` in your tests. It's not very explicit.
* In trie you're checking if something is strictly equal to null. At that point just say `if(!checkWord)`
* also i might break out the nest if/else statement into a new function. Recursion is great it just becomes hard to read when you're statements are really long.
* break out the `suggest` function into smaller pieces
