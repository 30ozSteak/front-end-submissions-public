## 1. Process

- "Whiteboard adding words to a trie"
  - solid. good vocab. all questions answered with a fair amount of confidence
- "whiteboard suggesting words given the first letters of a word"
- Whiteboard a new method `select`
  - good use of clarifying questions
  - had confusion over strategy to use for select
- Write tests for `select`
  - pretty good, needed some guidance

3: Developer has strategies for approaching complex challenges. Can explain thought process and strategy when prompted.

## 2. Fundamental JavaScript & Style

3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

## 3. Test-Driven Development & Code Sanitation

## 4. Functional Expectations

(tests for delete don't pass)

3: Application meets all requirements as laid out per the specification.
