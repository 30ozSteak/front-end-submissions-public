Comments:
* Keep practicing explaining your code and thought process to an audience
* Significant amount of tests don't pass
* Tests produce console logs
* `wordCount` should be a method `count()`, as per the project spec
* There's an extra file, `Container`
* Use more .forEach instead of for-of

## 1. Process

- Whiteboard adding words
  - hasn't practiced whiteboarding, needed coaching on whiteboarding
  - good process once we got going
  - solid problem decomposition
  - started with writing psudo code - be aware of the structures you use to solve the problem - why pick psudo coding
- Whiteboard suggest
  - had lots of challenges
- Whiteboard a new method `select`
  - didn't get there
- Write tests for `select`
  - whiteboarded the three phases of test
  - could identify the three phases easily
- Implement `select`

2: Developer demonstrates a haphazard, trial and error approach, without clear strategy. Developer does not articulate thought process clearly, and cannot explain the problem-solving strategies they utilized.

## 2. Fundamental JavaScript & Style

3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

## 3. Test-Driven Development & Code Sanitation

2: Application makes some use of tests, but the coverage is insufficient. Linting shows ten or fewer complaints.

## 4. Functional Expectations

3: Application meets all requirements as laid out per the specification.
2: Application runs, but does not work properly, or does not meet specifications.
