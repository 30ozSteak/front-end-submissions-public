Comments:
* Not all tests pass - either delete tests you don't need or pend them if you do want to keep them but don't have time to make them work now.
* should access this information via a `count()` method instead of a `totalWords` property
* good separation of test phases
* `findWord` should be a separate method, rather than declared inside of suggest function. You could even write tests for it!
