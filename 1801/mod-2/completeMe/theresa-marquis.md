### Comments:
- I don't think this code is indicative of how hard you worked
- I think that the problem is difficult but I think you learned alot
- I think if you made the value of each prefix not an array and just a string it would be easier to manage. 
### 1. Process

* 3: Developer has strategies for approaching complex challenges. Can explain thought process and strategy when prompted.

### 2. Fundamental JavaScript & Style

* 2:  Application runs but the code has long methods, unnecessary or poorly named variables, and needs significant refactoring


### 3. Test-Driven Development & Code Sanitation

* 2: Application makes some use of tests, but the coverage is insufficient. Linting shows ten or fewer complaints.


### 4. Functional Expectations

* 2: Application runs, but does not work properly, or does not meet specifications.
