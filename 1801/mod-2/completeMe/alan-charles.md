### Comments:
* Be mindful of your syntax. There were some random spaces in your test file / it had a `.only` on one of the tests.
* nested `if else` inside of `findWord` could potentially be broken into multiple functions. That would make that more readable.
* I'd probably change line 70 of select to be an `includes` instead of a find.

### 1. Process

* 2.5: Developer demonstrates a haphazard, trial and error approach, without clear strategy. Developer does not articulate thought process clearly, and cannot explain the problem-solving strategies they utilized.


### 2. Fundamental JavaScript & Style

* 4:  Application demonstrates excellent knowledge of JavaScript syntax, style, and refactoring
* 3:  Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring
* 2:  Application runs but the code has long methods, unnecessary or poorly named variables, and needs significant refactoring
* 1:  Application generates syntax error or crashes during execution

### 3. Test-Driven Development & Code Sanitation

* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality. Linting shows five or fewer complaints.

### 4. Functional Expectations

* 4: Application meets all requirements, and implements one extension properly.
* 3: Application meets all requirements as laid out per the specification.
* 2: Application runs, but does not work properly, or does not meet specifications.
* 1: Application does not run, crashes on start.
