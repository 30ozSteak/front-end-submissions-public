### Student:

### Project Name:  

#### Check In: 1  

#### Collaborators:  
This is going to be a solo project.

#### Project Pitch  
Given the two week time period, I plan on using Nightmare to scrap baseball-reference. With the data I want to display player cards, and have a generic ranking system. If the project is going well I want to work on implementing my formula to rank players based on what categories and position eligibility an individuals league is using.

### Deliverables  

#### APIs:  
I plan on using Nightmare to scrap baseball-reference.

#### Wireframes  
Include screenshots to wireframes or comps of **EVERY PAGE** of the MVP of your app. You can include these by adding additional files to your submissions directory, or linking to an imgur account. You're asked to use Sketch, or Balsamiq, or a different digital wireframe/comp application but if you choose to use pen/paper please let your instructors know and bring those to class Monday.  

#### Waffle.io
Link to your waffle.io account with at least 10 cards indicating baby steps to how you want to structure your attack.  


### Reflection  

#### Order Of Attack  
First thing I have to do is figure out how to scrap baseball-reference and figure out how to display the data in cards.

#### Nice To Haves
