#### Project Pitch  
This app facilitates a quick and painless way for a small group choose a place to get lunch.

### Deliverables  

#### APIs:  

Google Places: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/places

#### Wireframes  
I'm going for a simple panel based usage, so the user doesn't have a ton to think about each panel. I beleive these following frames are enough for MVP but I won't hesitate to add more panels as needed.

##### Voting Page

#### Waffle.io
https://waffle.io/zkc/Lunch-r
I've started my "plan of attack" on Trello, I'll migrate to Waffle. Also my new waffle is still stuck on ironing so....

### Reflection  

#### Order Of Attack  
I want to poke about with websockets first. If that feels right I'll build up the Voting/suggestions page first thing. Then I'll work thru the group creation process screens.  

#### Nice To Haves   
I really want basic user account/profile functions like saving/resusing a lunch group. The nice-to-have parts would be user preferences with food/resturant preferences automatically taken into account with the initial group suggestions. This would also need a way to store/manage users with-in a resused lunch group. Email notifications could be fun? 

#### Biggest Challenges  
The places data could be tricky. The googs docs seem good. 
I've no clue how the backend voting sessions will be handled. I know they can, websocket exploration should help start spelling that end of things out.  
Dynamic URL generation. Each group voting session will need a unique URL. Probably not hard. Probably?
