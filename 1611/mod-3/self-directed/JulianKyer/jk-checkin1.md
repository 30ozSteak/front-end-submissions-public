### Reflection  

#### Order Of Attack  
I will start by building the functionality of the app, then add styling as I get a better sense of what my options are and what visually makes sense. I'm not sure yet how I want it to look, but I know how I want it to function, so that will give me some time to research the aesthetic components.

#### Nice To Haves   
I'd like to have a contact form so that users who disagree or want to add suggestions are able to.

#### Biggest Challenges  
I'd really like to make something visually appealing, and to play with some more advanced CSS stuff. I think Bree and Louisa would be great resources there. The other challenge is that this is a somewhat simple app, so UI/UX is important, and I'd also like to focus on high code-quality. It's a case of me wanting to do something simple well, as opposed to having a really high goal that is executed poorly.
