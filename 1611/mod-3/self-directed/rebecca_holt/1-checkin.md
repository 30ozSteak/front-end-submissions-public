### Project Name:  
Flower/Floral Palette? Subject to change with better name ideas!

#### Check In: 1  

#### Collaborators:   
I will be working alone for this project and will not have any collaborators. (Unless I need someone to help me with Oauth for an image API)

#### Project Pitch  
With the popularity of websites like Pinterest, a lot of brides and grooms have unrealistic visions of their weddings especially in terms of budget and florals amongst many other wedding details. While working in the floral industry, I noticed a lot of brides and grooms coming in for consultations with images of bouquets that were their dream bouquet but they soon come to find that the flowers in the photos are out of season or extremely expensive. Basically a dream crusher... I want to create an app that will help brides to be (or grooms) decide what their main wedding flowers will be based on the season of their wedding and their color palette. To help avoid dream crushing in floral consultations. This app will take 4 parameters (season, and three colors) and generate a list of flowers that will be in season and available for their wedding.

### Deliverables  

#### APIs:  
I would like to use one of these for images of the flowers. I am on the hunt for an API without OAuth(or have someone in the back-end help me with OAuth) but great flower photos.

Pinterest's API - needs OAuth (may need help with that)
ShutterStock's API - needs OAuth (may need help with that)
Pixabay - Free and no OAuth but I don't really like the photos, kind of cheesy.
Google Custom API - reading up on it but can't quite understand it.
Unsplash - free and easy but not all flower images....
Bing Images Search - free and no Oauth from what I can see but documentation is a little hard for me to understand.

### Reflection  

#### Order Of Attack  
1. Build out JSON object of data (20 flowers)
2. Take photos of flowers or decide on an image search API
3. Build welcome page
4. Build form page (dropdown menus)
5. Display list of flowers in season at that time
6. Display list of available colors
7. Display images of flowers
8. Display color palette
9. Change UI features to match that of color palette or season

Extensions
1. Save and email to provided email
2. Flower/color palette grid
3. 0 Axe violations


#### Nice To Haves   
-Incorporate the user's color palette/season (seasonal colors) into the UI of the project.
-User is able to save information and email themselves their list of flowers.
-All images done by me (I know it will be extra time and work but I like the idea of creating everything from the ground up).
-Color palette and flower palette grid that displays user's colors and a few photos from their search. (last priority in terms of extensions)

#### Biggest Challenges
One of my challenges will be where to source my flower data from. I was thinking I could hardcode the data for 20 flowers and use that since I have background knowledge from working in the floral industry. I would prefer to build out a JSON object with all of the necessary data in it. That way I can only use the top wedding flowers brides ask for. I could also scrap the web for the information I need. I have three floral wholesaler websites I would be able to grad information from. Mayersh, Amato's, and Bliss (there are definitely more out there but I am most familiar with those three).

Image sourcing is my next biggest concern. I haven't been able to find a free non OAuth API yet that I am happy with. Which means I will have to get a back-end person to help me out or settle with poor images. I have several image API's listed above. I was a photo major in college, so the other option would be to take the images myself of the 20 flowers I decide to hardcode. That way the entire app will be handcrafted by me, which I like the idea of. I can go back to the flower shop I worked at and take photos of my favorite flowers one day for a hour or two - max. I also have a huge image library of photos I have taken that I can look through for most flowers. If I go the API route, I definitely still want to source some of the app images (background or header) from my image library.

One of my extensions would be to export the list of flowers to whatever email is provided. Kenia was telling me that someone from the last mod did that for their project so I can ask them for help. I can't seem to find exactly what I want on the web, but I may be searching the wrong thing...I may need some guidance for that one from Brenna or Taylor.
