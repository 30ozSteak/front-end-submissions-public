Tim Brandle

### Project Name:  
Travel App (name TBD)

#### Check In: 1  

#### Collaborators:  
Are you working with anyone else?
No. I am working solo.

#### Project Pitch  

My app will be a travel app.  The idea is to crowdsource travel itineraries to locals  who know all the "must-see" local spots in their hometown. This will allow the user to find travel suggestions from locals that have similar interests as them.

MVP:
    * Login
    * Add Itinerary
    * Save Itinerary
    * View Itinerary
    * Delete (own) Itinerary?
    * View Others
    * Favorite

### Reflection  

#### Order Of Attack  
Based on your wireframes, in what order are you going to approach building out this application?

1. Log in component
  * when registering for a profile, user should pick travel interests.


2. Build out the add itinerary page.
  * get google maps component
  * user should be able to add individual destinations to the itinerary
  * save the itinerary
  * view their created itineraries.


3. Like and favorite.
  * user should be able to add to his/her wishlist.
  * like an itinerary


4. Build out the home page.
  * route homepage to individual itinerary page


5. User profile
  * profile will have a wish list and a list of itineraries built
  * The user likes will be the total amount of itinerary likes.


#### Nice To Haves   
What are your reach features? Ie: "Web Sockets & 3D Animations!"

* Facebook login.
* add feature to tag individual itineraries with travel interests

#### Biggest Challenges  
The biggest challenge I foresee is tagging the itineraries.
