Nope.

#### Project Pitch  
I've always wanted to start a book club, I've tried many times but it always comes down to how far away all of my friends live from each other. I wanted to make an app that would help people find book lovers near them that were also interested in book clubs and help them meet up. It's also always a struggle to pick a book once you've got a club going. So I thought that a randomly generated book based off of everyones preferences would make life easier.

#### Biggest Challenges  
I think the google maps locations will be difficult. The idea is that a user can set a range of how far out they are willing to go away from their home and then there will have suggested people that could be a part of their book club. I also think that finding the right API for book swill be hard and figuring out what to do if a user can't find a book they are looking for.
