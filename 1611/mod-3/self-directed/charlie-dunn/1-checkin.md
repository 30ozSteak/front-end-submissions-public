### Student:
Charlie Dunn

### Project Name:
Semantic Arts CMS

#### Check In: 1  

#### Collaborators:  
I'm working with the Semantic Arts team.

#### Project Pitch  
The plan is still somewhat in flux due to the fact that I'm working with Semantic Arts. We've had an initial project scope meeting and have another call scheduled for 4/10 to kickoff the project and talk through the details.

The project idea is to create a custom CMS for the future Semantic Arts marketing website. The core functionality will allow users to create new web pages, edit existing pages and add pages to the site's navigation. Eventually user login and a blog page will be added as well.

### Deliverables  
See wireframes directory

#### APIs:  
No APIs at this time.

#### Wireframes

#### Waffle.io
- Waiting to create the project repo until kickoff call with Semantic Arts on 4/10

Steps:
* Work through environment set up
* Get webpack up and running
* Create file structure (talk with Semantic Arts about their organizational preferences)
* Import all modules for testing
* Get router working
* Get redux working
* Map out components needed for phase 1
* Plan out stateful components vs. functional components
* Anticipate which props need to be passed to each component
* Make changes to UI/Wireframes based on feedback

#### Order Of Attack  
* Webpack/package.json set up
* Set up Redux
* Set up Router
* Header component
* Sidebar navigation component
* Create page component
  - Research npm module react-rte
* View pages component
* Explore adding current pages to navbar

#### Nice To Haves   
* Custom formatting for new pages
* Blog page

#### Biggest Challenges  
I think the biggest challenge is going to be time. It's sizeable project with a lot of functionality so time management is going to be key. Additionally, I think creating page templates that meet the formatting/layout requirements is going to be difficult. I found an npm module that allows for rich text editing, but I need to do further research to see if the project will require additional functionality.
