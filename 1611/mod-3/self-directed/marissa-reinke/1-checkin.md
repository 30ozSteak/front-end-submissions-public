### Project Name: The Trendy Hiker

#### Check In: 1

#### Collaborators:
None as of now

#### Project Pitch
My plan is to have an app that the user can swipe through and based off photos and distance can decide if they would like to go on that hike. If they swipe yes on it then it'll open to more info about the hike and give a location.

### Deliverables

#### APIs:

Used pen to paper

### Reflection

#### Order Of Attack
I think the best attack will be going through the app like my user would. So login, setup profile, then swiping for hikes. The rest would come after.

#### Nice To Haves
Really slick UI/UX and setting up an oauth

#### Biggest Challenges
Not getting overwhelmed and having to make my own timeline. It's easy to get ahead of myself. I'll definitely plan out my app in phases for MVP to help keep me grounded with it and on task.
