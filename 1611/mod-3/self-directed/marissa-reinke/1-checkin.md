### Student: Marissa Reinke

### Project Name:  

#### Check In: 1  

#### Collaborators:  
not as of now

#### Project Pitch  
To create an app that the user can base if they would or would not like to do a hike based solely on photos.
If the user swipes in favor of the hike then a profile of that hike will come on the screen.
That will display the name, distance away, difficulty, and hopefully a brief description. Pipe dream would be able to have the users sign in through facebook and they can see if anyone else has ever done the hike and any comments if they have.

### Deliverables  

#### APIs:  
Still emailing out for APIs. If none come back I will mock out my own data of 20 or so hikes.

#### Wireframes  
Notebook drawings.

### Reflection  

#### Order Of Attack  
I am going to focus first on the swiping aspect and getting the information passed from a card if the user swipes yes on it to its own profile.

From that point I would work on saving hikes with specific users and a sign in option.

#### Nice To Haves   
The ux/ui of swiping and utilizing location/gps.

#### Biggest Challenges  
I think my biggest challenge will be keeping on task and not going down rabbit holes. Hopefully breaking it out into phases and having a solid mvp for the end of each will keep that in line.
