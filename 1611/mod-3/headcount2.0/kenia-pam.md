## Notes:  

## Specification Adherence
- 2 - The application is in a usable state, but is missing 1 of the features outlined in the specification above.

## Code Quality
- 2 - Developer selected appropriate libraries and frameworks to build the app but did not use them as intended. Significant refactoring necessary.

## CSS/Design
- 2 - Developer has made intentional design decisions to create a user friendly application but Louisa would be mad.

## Testing
- 2 - A valid attempt was made to test functionality with obvious gaps where functionality is not tested
