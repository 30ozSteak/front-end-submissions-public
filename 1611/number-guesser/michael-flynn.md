Michael may take the weekend to work on the project and we'll re-evaluate low scores on Monday.

### UX/UI Expectations

- 2.5: Application meets the basic spirit of the comp but overlooks many details. Extensions show questionable design decisions that negatively impact the overall UX/UI.

### Functional Expectations

- 2: Application meets all of the functional expectations in Phase One

### Fundamental HTML

- 2.5:  Developer writes effective HTML, but does not write semantically correct and clearly organized code. Application shows some effort to use semantically correct HTML, but the divisions are inconsistent or unclear. There are many un-semantic tags and unnecessary selectors and it is not clear to the evaluator what a given section of code represents visually. Developer cannot speak to every line of code.

### Fundamental CSS

- 2.5:  Your application has some duplication and minor bugs. Developer can speak to most choices made in the code and knows what every line is doing.

### Fundamental JavaScript

- 2.5: Application runs but the code is confusing with unnecessary or poorly named variables, functions, and unclear organization, structure, and/or duplication
