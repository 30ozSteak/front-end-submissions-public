# Evaluation Rubric
## Project: Complete-Me
## Instructor: Nathaniel
## Comments:

### 1. Fundamental JavaScript & Style

* 2:  Application runs but the code has long methods, unnecessary or poorly named variables, and needs significant refactoring

### 2. Enumerable & Collections

* 2: Application demonstrates functional knowledge of Enumerable but only uses the most basic techniques

### 3. Test-Driven Development

* 2.5: Application makes some use of tests, but the coverage is insufficient

Would like to see testing of nested properties, and testing length of dictionary

### 4. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

* 2.5: Application shows some effort to break logic into components, but the divisions are inconsistent or unclear

### 5. Functional Expectations

* 2.5: Application runs, but does not work properly, or does not meet specifications.
