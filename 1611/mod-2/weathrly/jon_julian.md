## Specification Adherence

Has one axe violation but developers spent a significant amount of time researching the violation and testing in chrome vox and tab through and disagreed with the violation for this application/use case. Reasonable explanation. 

4 - The application meets all of the requirements listed above and implements one or more of the extensions.

## User Interface

3.5 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality. The application less than 3 aXe-core violations

## HTML Style

Developers switched over to divs quite a bit - html is laid out semantically.

Would recommend going through and switching to semantic html instead of divs.

If changes made, will bump to 3.

2.5: Developer writes effective HTML, but does not write semantically correct and clearly organized code. Application shows some effort to use semantically correct HTML, but the divisions are inconsistent or unclear. There are many un-semantic tags and unnecessary selectors and it is not clear to the evaluator what a given section of code represents visually. Developer cannot speak to every line of code.

## CSS/Sass Style

3.5: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS/Sass is doing.

## JavaScript Style

Keep an eye on making sure your data cleaners don't fall over easily.

Extremely well refactored components!

Very solid 3

3- Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

## Testing

Make sure you test your helpers.

3 - Project has a running test suite that tests and multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All functionality is covered by tests. The application makes some use of feature testing.

## Workflow

3 - The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.

## Code Sanitation

Do a little research into how to tell the linter in the eslintrc file that you're using React. Otherwise go with the disabling the specific rule.

DM with chosen fix when fixed and score will be ammended.

The output from a code sanitizer (either JSHint or ESLint) showsâ€¦

1 - More than ten complaints
