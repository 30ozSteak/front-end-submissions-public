### Evaluator: Robbie

### Notes:

  * Too many media queries in CSS, one or two less could have been possible
  * Well refactored JS code, like the small functions and use of function reference in event listener
  * Git workflow needs work: more conversation, commenting, and equal contribution of the code base in terms of languages (one person doesn't do all the CSS or JS and visa versa)

### Functional Expectations

- 4: Application meets all of the functional expectations in Phase Three.

### Fundamental JavaScript Style

- 3.5: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring.

### Workflow

- 2.5: The developer makes large commits covering multiple features that make it difficult for the evaluator to determine the evolution of the application.

### HTML Style

- 3:  Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing.

### CSS Style

- 3:  Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS is doing.
