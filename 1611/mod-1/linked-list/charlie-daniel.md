### Evaluator: Robbie

### Notes:

  * Using vanilla JS, pretty cool to see the difference when you get to jQuery - could do a little more refactoring and breaking out similar functionality, also some unnecessary code with if/else statement checking the input values
  * Work on adding shared CSS classes for elements that are styled the same, reduced repetition in CSS
  * Workflow needs work, both people should drive and commit equally, and need more conversation in pull requests

### Functional Expectations

- 3: Application meets all of the functional expectations in Phase Two.

### Fundamental JavaScript Style

- 3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring.

### Workflow

- 2: The developer makes large commits covering multiple features that make it difficult for the evaluator to determine the evolution of the application.

### HTML Style

- 3:  Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing.

### CSS Style

- 3:  Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS is doing.
