### Evaluator: Robbie

### Notes:

  * jQuery and JS looked pretty clean, could use some refactoring to pull out some logic with if/else statements
  * Couldn't assess much on workflow because you weren't paired with anyone, but would have liked to see smaller commits so that when you do get in a partner situation, then the pull requests they have to review aren't huge
  * Use more shared CSS classes to reduce repetition in styling

### Functional Expectations

- 4: Application meets all of the functional expectations in Phase Three.

### Fundamental JavaScript Style

- 3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring.

### Workflow

- 3: The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.

### HTML Style

- 3:  Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing.

### CSS Style

- 3:  Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS is doing.
