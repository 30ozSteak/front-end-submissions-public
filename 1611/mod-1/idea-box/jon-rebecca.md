### Evaluator: Robbie

### Notes:

  * Some conversation in PRs, but not enough context about code changes in the description of the PR
  * JS code was clean, but needed some refactoring
  * HTML section for containing ideas was overstructured with div and unordered list
  * CSS matched the comp pretty well
  * Workflow was good with a lot of small commits

### Specification Adherence

* 3 **SOLID** - The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by jQuery. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.

### HTML Style

- 3:  Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing.

### CSS Style

- 3.5:  Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS is doing.

### JavaScript Style

* 3- Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

### Workflow

* 4 - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

### Collaboration

* 3 **SOFT** - Team members employ PRs and [issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/) to both manage their work and communication/collaboration around executing the tasks.
