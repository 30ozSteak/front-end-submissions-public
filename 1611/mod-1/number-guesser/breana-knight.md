Breana may take the weekend to work on the project and we'll re-evaluate low scores on Monday.

### UX/UI Expectations

- 2.5: Application meets the basic spirit of the comp but overlooks many details. Extensions show questionable design decisions that negatively impact the overall UX/UI.

### Functional Expectations

- 2.5: Application meets all of the functional expectations in Phase One

### Fundamental HTML

- 3:  Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing.

### Fundamental CSS

- 3:  Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS is doing.

### Fundamental JavaScript

- 2.5: Application runs but the code is confusing with unnecessary or poorly named variables, functions, and unclear organization, structure, and/or duplication
