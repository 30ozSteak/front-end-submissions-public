### Evaluator: Robbie

### Notes:

Similar feedback I saw for everyone I evaluated:

* Need to break out functionality of long JavaScript functions: pieces of code that have similar functionality can be grouped together and refactored to have cleaner, more readable functions throughout
* Naming of JavaScript variables and functions should be descriptive (so you can come back to the code much later and be able to understand what each piece is doing without running through all of the logic again)
* CSS needs to match the comp exactly for desktop and mobile view
* For HTML, take advantage of shared classes between elements that are styled the same way (try to get away from CSS selectors directly on elements, like buttons, because you will have buttons with different styles on the page)

### UX/UI Expectations

- 4: Application matches comp exactly. There are no omitted details. Any extensions are intuitive, well designed, easy to use, and in keeping with the visuals outlined in the comp. Virtually no major improvements are needed in the UX or UI.

### Functional Expectations

- 3: Application meets all of the functional expectations in Phase Two

### Fundamental HTML

- 3:  Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing.

### Fundamental CSS

- 3:  Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS is doing.

### Fundamental JavaScript

- 3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and proper syntax
