## Completion

#### Were you able to complete the base functionality?
* Yes

#### Which extensions, if any, did you complete?

- We were not able to get to neither of the extentions

# Code Quality

#### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you are proud of
(https://github.com/ActionJonny/jet-fuel/blob/master/server.js)#L28-L40

* We were happy to be able to increment the visits - on the server side - and figure out how to redirect the user in the same get method. We are also pretty happy with our css fade-in/fade-out, and the input animation used for the sidebar.

#### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you feel not great about
(https://github.com/ActionJonny/jet-fuel/blob/master/public/script.js)#L52-L67

* We did not have a chance to refactor this code block using semantic html.

#### Attach a screenshot or paste the output from your terminal of the result of your test-suite running.
