# Code Quality

#### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you are proud of
[Link to code block in repo](https://github.com/kfarias/jet-fuel/blob/8d0babe18b4ac0039a68f00cb3a63c7238c23d2f/server.js#L63-L70)

* Why were you proud of this piece of code?

We struggled for awhile to figure out how to increment the visits to each URL along with redirecting to the original URL. It was particularly satisfying to get this piece of code working and get a small win using a new framework.

#### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you feel not great about
[Link to code block in repo](https://github.com/kfarias/jet-fuel/blob/8d0babe18b4ac0039a68f00cb3a63c7238c23d2f/test/routes.spec.js#L14-L30)

* Why do you feel not awesome about the code? What challenges did you face trying to write/refactor it?

We had some trouble setting up our testing environment and once it was set up seeding the test database did not seem to be consistent. Folders and links were changing positions in the returned array causing a lot of issues with testing. Our assumption is something is off with our before and afterEach blocks.

#### Attach a screenshot or paste the output from your terminal of the result of your test-suite running.
