#### Completion
We were able to complete the base functionality but no extensions.

#### Code Quality
[Happy Code A](https://github.com/zkc/JetFuel/blob/cecbad64cd4d2f92e07e6b60c86e62f840be9205/server.js#L18-L28)

I just like this piece of code. It's basically from one of the lessons, but it puts something visual on the page right away, and shifted my perspective on how the app is structured.

[Happy Code B](https://github.com/zkc/JetFuel/blob/cecbad64cd4d2f92e07e6b60c86e62f840be9205/public/index.js#L45-L48)

I'm throwing this in there too, because I'd always wondered how URL-shortening services worked, and where those seemingly random strings came from. Didn't realize it was this easy.

[Sad Code](https://github.com/zkc/JetFuel/blob/cecbad64cd4d2f92e07e6b60c86e62f840be9205/server.js#L52-L61)

I think kinda put error-handling on the back-burner as we were trying to figure things out, and that bums me out.

I enjoyed this project, learning how to hook everything up to build a real app was cool. The backend stuff hurt my brain a little bit, but I like the possibilities it unlocked.
