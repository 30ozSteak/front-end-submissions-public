## Completion

#### Were you able to complete the base functionality?
* Yes - Brittany said that we could focus on testing and not complete date/visited and sorting. We have the date created and visits displaying but no sorting. The visited increments but does not instantly update on page. 

#### Which extensions, if any, did you complete?

- N/A

# Code Quality

#### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you are proud of
[Link to code block in repo - Testing for server-side](https://github.com/becs919/jet-fuel/blob/37aeda6718b027f94f5a93ba408cd0a5cf7b5f0b/server.js)

* Why were you proud of this piece of code?

We're really proud that we set up our testing environment and wrote sad/happy tests for all endpoints - especially with how new all of this is.  

#### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you feel not great about
[Link to code block in repo - 2nd migration](https://github.com/becs919/jet-fuel/tree/master/db/migrations)

* Why do you feel not awesome about the code? What challenges did you face trying to write/refactor it?

We felt great that Brittany had us make a new migration even though it scared us, but now we know how to do it. We weren't proud that we named our columns with dashes at first resulting in us having to make a new migration. We learned to never use dashes in column names. We also made 2 more migrations to drop timestamps and add it back in with the arguments of true,true.

#### Attach a screenshot or paste the output from your terminal of the result of your test-suite running.

#### Provide a link to an example, if you have one, of a test that covers an 'edge case' or 'unhappy path'

#### Please feel free to ask any other questions or make any other statements below!

We strayed a lot from our wireframes. We were focusing too much at the beginning of our project on UX/UI and not focusing on the database itself. When we started putting our energy into our database, the UX/UI was left behind. We aren't very proud of our front-end but our database is doing the thing and we have tested it! Also, our visited increments but doesn't automatically load on page when you redirect. That is something we would have liked to finish. 

Questions: How do we practice/learn how to test better?
