Reason you are proud of code

* This piece of code was a big struggle but in the end it taught us a lot about the query process.



#### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you feel not great about

* Why do you feel not awesome about the code? What challenges did you face trying to write/refactor it?

While this code is awesome and we are very happy with it in some ways, it feels a bit hacky. We would like to refactor this and streamline the code.

#### Please feel free to ask any other questions or make any other statements below!

We added in a regex verification to our url input and a verification to our name input field as well shortly before 
the project was due. We did not have time to complete a unit test for this feature. We have the functionality for
time and visits but did not get it implemented on the front end. We chose to focus our time 
towards the end on server-side testing and styling our application. Overall, we are really happy
with our project. As with all projects, we wish we had more time but we learned so much about 
how the front and back end connect. We were especially happy with our progress learning to 
test the server side and set up endpoints.
