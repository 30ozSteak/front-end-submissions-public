This code feels pretty hackey. I particularly dont like the nested ifs. The main challenge was checking for 3 different senarios.

#### Please feel free to ask any other questions or make any other statements below!

This project was a major struggle for me. I think the main source of my trouble was that it shined a light on all the gaps in my knowledge. I plan to continue to work toward completion as well as rebuilding for my mod 3 personal site.
