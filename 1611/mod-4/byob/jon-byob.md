# Code Quality

#### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you are proud of
[Link to code block in repo](https://github.com/ActionJonny/BYOB/blob/master/server.js#L127-L143)

* I found it very difficult removing a row with a foreign key pointing to it. The part that tripped me up the most was not realizing it was not deleting the player from the database, it was moving them after I changed the team_id to null.

#### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you feel not great about
[Link to code block in repo](https://github.com/ActionJonny/BYOB/blob/master/server.js#L74-L143)

* It is weird that this block includes the code I am most proud of, but pretty bummed I wasn't able to including my JWT's in these methods.
