Note: I started this project over yesterday afternoon after unsuccessfully trying to fix my original. 

### Completion
##### Seeded a database with at least 2 tables and 1 relationship? 
Yes

##### Had at least 10 endpoints that returned responses with appropriate status codes? 
Yes 

##### Secured at least 4 endpoints with JWTs?
No

##### Enforced a linter and wrote code that conformed to it?
No

##### Wrote tests for both happy and sad paths for each endpoint? 
No

##### Setup automatic deployments with CircleCI to a production app on Heroku? 
Something in there is broken but I don't know what. Yet.

### Code Quality
I like [this](https://github.com/juliankyer/db-edm/blob/8053c4c5cda31df2ff72b0d7d9fd0c9b0caf12ff/server.js#L122-L129) chunk of code because it was where these requests started making sense to me.

I'm not crazy about [this](https://github.com/juliankyer/db-edm/blob/8053c4c5cda31df2ff72b0d7d9fd0c9b0caf12ff/server.js#L63-L72) chunk of code because error handling is still a thorn in my side, and I'd like to see more on how to do that correctly.
