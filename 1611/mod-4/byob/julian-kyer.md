### Code Quality
I like [this](https://github.com/juliankyer/db-edm/blob/f01be61d33bcbafbad13f7d51422b5ba5c50eb24/server.js#L129-L141) chunk of code because I learned a lot in terms of figuring out how to handle errors and do some basic authorization checks. The if/else also caused some linter errors and I liked having to dig into that to figure out why.

I'm not crazy about [this](https://github.com/juliankyer/db-edm/blob/f01be61d33bcbafbad13f7d51422b5ba5c50eb24/server.js#L37-L54) chunk of code because it is from a lesson, so it wasn't something I wrote or struggled with, it was something I implemented. But I really like what it allows me to do in my project.
