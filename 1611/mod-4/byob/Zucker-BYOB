# Code Quality

#### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you are proud of
[Link to code block in repo](https://github.com/zkc/antiqueBox/blob/master/server.js#L33-L56)

* Why were you proud of this piece of code?

Initially I wasn't 100% sold on my choice to separating listings from individual items. This block gave me confidence that the division was a worthwhile. I'm proud of my mapping table that links items and listings.

#### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you feel not great about
[Link to code block in repo](https://github.com/zkc/antiqueBox/blob/master/server.js#L118)

* Why do you feel not awesome about the code? What challenges did you face trying to write/refactor it?

This is kind of a bug with knex, ultimately I want to reorganize this promise flow

Anything else you wanna say!

I'm obviously not done with the project as of May 19. I will be continuing to work on this as I plan on building a front end and launching this site. This plan put me into a mindset where I felt compelled to make sure I was confident in my design decisions before progressing. Ultimately this created a reduction in priority of some elements of the assignment. Additionally I've had major job stress this week that I've yet to handle well and which hindered my progress. Overall I’m ecstatic to have a functioning pipeline, now I’m in a great place to be building up significantly more this weekend.
