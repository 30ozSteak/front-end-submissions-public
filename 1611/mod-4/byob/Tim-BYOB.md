# Code Quality

#### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you are proud of
[Link to code block in repo](https://github.com/tbrandle/mountains_backend/blob/master/turing/mod-4-projects/BYOB-mountains/db/seeds/dev/mountains.js#L19)

* Why were you proud of this piece of code?

The file seeding took forever to solve, but I think this solution is a clever one. I paired with Brittany to solve it, but walking away, I feel I have a much better understanding of how knex works with promises.

#### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you feel not great about
[Link to code block in repo](https://github.com/tbrandle/mountains_backend/blob/master/turing/mod-4-projects/BYOB-mountains/server.js#L141)

* Why do you feel not awesome about the code? What challenges did you face trying to write/refactor it?

Inside the post mountains end point, I was trying to verify if the range existed in the database.  If it did, send back the id and post the mountain with the foreign id. This part works fine. If the mountain range doesn't exist, I was trying to create the new range, send back the id, then create the new mountain.

For some reason I couldn't get it to work.  I have a feeling it was async issues or just being too nested. Either way, to solve the problem, I simply threw an error.

#### Please feel free to ask any other questions or make any other statements below!

Anything else you wanna say!

I had some very strange issues with eslint and my testing suite. That was the only thing keeping me from deploying. Everything else on circleCI seems to be set up correctly, but it wont let me deploy with the error in the test.  I found a snippet of code for eslint to ignore the testing suite, but it won't work if it is commented out.  If I un comment the line, all my testing errors go away except for the snippet itself.
