# Code Quality

#### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you are proud of
[Link to code block in repo](https://github.com/kfarias/BYOB/blob/master/db/seeds/dev/people.js)

* I think this was a really cool learning experience. I was trying to seed 4 files and was having issues with them seeding at weird times so the forEach helped to condense everything and kept my seed in the right order. I am also really proud that I was able to do three migrations.

#### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you feel not great about
[Link to code block in repo](https://github.com/kfarias/BYOB/blob/master/test/routes.spec.js)

* I was not super happy with my tests so I think i will make sure that all of the endpoint are tested before I feel 100%.

#### Please feel free to ask any other questions or make any other statements below!

I learned so much during this project. I would have liked to have more work time, but overall it was a really cool project and I feel much more comfortable using Postgres and making data tables.
