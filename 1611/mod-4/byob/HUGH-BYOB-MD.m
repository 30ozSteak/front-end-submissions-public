# Code Quality
- Super great!

#### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you are proud of
[Link to code block in repo](https://github.com/hmorri32/byo-backend/blob/master/routes/index.js#L122-L150)

* Why were you proud of this piece of code?
This was my first succesful PUT request! It solidified my knowledge of HTTP request as well as restful API basics. 
It also cemented my knowledge surrounding how the database actually interacts with knex/express. Super cool stuff.
I also implemented some ultra robust error handling. Which was neat. 

#### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you feel not great about
[Link to code block in repo](https://github.com/hmorri32/byo-backend/blob/master/routes/index.js#L184-L213)

* Why do you feel not awesome about the code? What challenges did you face trying to write/refactor it?
This is a link to one of my handy PATCH works. I forced the request to include certain params and those params only. 
I would have like for it to be more dynamic. IE, I wish I could have patched up one or many key value pairs as opposed to
only the three I wrote. I would have gotten there, just ran out of time.
