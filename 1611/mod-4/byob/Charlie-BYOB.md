# Code Quality

#### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you are proud of
[Link to code block in repo](https://github.com/dunncl15/BYOB/blob/master/server.js#L48-L63)

* Why were you proud of this piece of code?
I thought using .some was a good way to approach validating that a PATCH request has at least one of the required park properties. If someone tries a PATCH with an arbitrary property that is not listed in parkProps then it will throw an error.

However, it still fails when you submit a PATCH with multiple properties and at least one property is included in the parkProps array. Ex/

{ name: 'New Park',
  mumbo_jumbo: 'adfadf' }

This error isn't caught because the .some recognizes the name property so the condition is met.

#### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you feel not great about
[Link to code block in repo](https://github.com/dunncl15/BYOB/blob/master/db/seeds/dev/locations.js#L21-L28)

* Why do you feel not awesome about the code? What challenges did you face trying to write/refactor it?

Promises are still a bit confusing to me. I have a hard time following when a Promise is resolved and this particular code block is confusing from that stand point.
