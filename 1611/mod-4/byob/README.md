## Instructor Evaluation Points

The following set of points are distributed at the discretion of the instructor.

### Endpoints

* **60 points** - Developer has implemented all 10 endpoints, 4 are secured via JWTs and one is a custom endpoint that filters data based on query params.
* **40 points** - Developer has implemented all 10 endpoints but did not secure 4 of them with JWTs or have a custom endpoint based on query params.
* **20 points** - Developer is missing endpoints and has not secured or customized any of the ones that have been implemented.

### Data Persistence with SQL Database

* **40 points** - The application persists data in a SQL database but with correct relationships between folders and URLs.
* **20 points** - The application persists data in a SQL database but with some incorrect relationships between folders and URLs.
* **0 points** - The application does not persist data in a SQL database.

### Testing & Linting

* **30 points** - Project has a running test suite that covers all happy and sad paths for the appropriate endpoints. The project has a linting configuration that passes with no errors.
* **20 points** - Project has a running test suite that covers most happy and sad paths for each endpoint. Linter has some errors that need fixing.
* **10 points** - Project has significant lack of testing for happy and sad paths of endpoints; Linter is failing on multiple lines.

### JavaScript Style

* **20 points** - Application has exceptionally well-factored code with little or no duplication and all components separated out into logical components. There _zero_ instances where an instructor would recommend taking a different approach.
* **15 points** - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.
* **12 points** - Your application has some duplication and minor bugs. Developer can speak to most choices made in the code and knows what every line is doing.
* **5 points** - Your application has a significant amount of duplication and one or more major bugs. Developer cannot speak to most choices and does not know what every line of code is doing.
