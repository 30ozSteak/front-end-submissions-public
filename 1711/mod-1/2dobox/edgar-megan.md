## Notes/What To Work On:

- UI needs polishing, doesn’t break down to smaller screens smoothly.
- CSS needs a refactor pass.
- JS still has quiet a few opportunities to refactor and reduce duplication
- make sure you are pushing hard and really tightening up the last 10% of the project. There are lose ends that you had time to address, and you’re selling yourselves short by not pushing hard to make things as tight as possible.
