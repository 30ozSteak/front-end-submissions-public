## Students: Maddy & Chase
## Evaluator: Pamela Lovett
## Notes/What To Work On:

### DESIGN/COMP
- Made it through Phase 3 w/no bugs
- Like the range of colors on filtering buttons
- "Minimalized approach" makes text hard to read. Love the take on it, but bump it up a bit
- Small tweaks with spacing
- Only need filtering for importance. For the future, be sure to clarify specs with instructors when unsure

### HTML
- Be sure to run your app through a screen reader  - although the main form is okay, the dynamically generated cards are not accessible.

### CSS
- Nice job condensing a lot of the CSS
- Like to hear that you used dev tools to debug/check selectors in CSS
- Good job organizing declarations within selectors alphabetically. Next time, try using [Idiomatic CSS](https://github.com/necolas/idiomatic-css) for organizing declarations

### JS
- Global array in line 26?
- Only pass in dynamic arguments in line 50 for constructor - `title`, `body`, `id`. `this.completed` property could be set up as boolean of true/false
- Unclear why you have a prepend and append function
- At times, code can be hard to follow/read
- `editContentTitle` & `editContentBody` could be refactored to a single function. Also - be sure to priortize using dot notation over bracket notation when the property you are accessing is not dynamic (lines 131, 140):
```js
parsedIdea.title = $(this).html();
```
- Opportunites for refactoring in filtering functions

### GIT/GITHUB
- Be more descriptive in naming for branches
- Pretty naming on commits - could sometimes be a bit more descriptive
