## Notes/What To Work On:

### DESIGN
- Update to let user know range
- Catch edge cases beyond setting the input `type` to number - add input validation

### HTML
- Watch indentation/spacing
- Good use of semantic HTML - keep moving forward with ARIA

### CSS
- Use [Idiomatic CSS](https://github.com/necolas/idiomatic-css) for organization

### JS
- Functionality split up well
- Good job speaking to your code
