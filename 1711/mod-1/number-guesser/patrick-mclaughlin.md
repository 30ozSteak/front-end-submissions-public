### DESIGN
- Update design for user guess - hard to read some text
- Appreciate the surprise background changes!!!

### HTML
- Hooray for tabindex, semantic HTML, labels, AND running through a screenreader!

### CSS
- Use [Idiomatic CSS](https://github.com/necolas/idiomatic-css) for organization

### JS
