## Notes/What To Work On:

### DESIGN
- Like that it logs the # of times a user answers correctly - nice addition!
- Some small design changes could be made to improve UI/UX

### HTML
- Good indentation, spacing, and semantic HTML
- Continue to push forward with ARIA w/labels and lang attribute

### CSS
- Use [Idiomatic CSS](https://github.com/necolas/idiomatic-css) for organization

### JS
- Good naming conventions
- Some opportunities for refactoring - but pretty well refactored from where you had it prir to eval!
