## Student: Eloi Mercado

## Notes/What To Work On:

### html
* Love the kabob case and indentation
* Inputs should always have a label

### css
* Dry it up
* Add comments for better organization
* Pick convention for organizing inside blocks

### js
* Dry it up by breaking similar blocks of code into functions
* Remove lines in between variable declarations
* Try using more action like words for functions ie. generateNewNumber instead of newRandom number, setRange and winGame are good names
* Try using more local vars and pass them around functions as arguments
