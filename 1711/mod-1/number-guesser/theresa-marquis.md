## Notes/What To Work On:

### DESIGN
- Comp recreation is lacking. UX/UI is an essential part of having a working, deliverable application.

### HTML
- Continue to use semantic HTML elements
- Remove unneccessary spacing in HTML file. Add labels for buttons and inputs. Run app through a screenreader next time

### CSS
- Watch syntax in CSS file. Use [Idiomatic CSS](https://github.com/necolas/idiomatic-css) for organization

### JS
- Good use of parameters/arguments
- Consistently use semi-colons
- Work on naming conventions in JS
