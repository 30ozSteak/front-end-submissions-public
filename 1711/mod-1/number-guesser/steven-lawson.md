## Notes/What To Work On:

### DESIGN
- Majority of comp recreation aligns with provided comp
- Be mindful of all details when recreating comp - spacing, sizing, etc.

### HTML
- Nice work with ARIA - semantic elements, forms, labels, inputs
- Work on syntax in HTML- no spacing between lines and watch indentation

### CSS
- Be sure to take advantage of cascading styles to avoid redundancy
- Reference Idiomatic CSS style guide for formatting and organization

### JS
- Good start with breaking functionality apart
- Refactoring opportunities in JS: some redundancy, unclear why you are pulling same value from input in multiple areas 
- Work on function naming in JS - can be hard to follow at times
