## Notes/What To Work On:

### comp
* The linked list title should not wrap at any breakpoint
* nice job having the two columns of cards

### html
* would probably move the p tags out of the form

### css
* Consider adding comments for different sections of your css
* Use convention for organization within blocks - ie. idiomatic or alphabetized
* Move media queries to bottom of file
* When I see negative values for margins, that tells me I can probably add margin to another element and achieve the same result

### js
* Consider using template literals to simplify appending things to the dom
* Break out similar blocks of code into their own functions and pass dynamic pieces as arguments

### git/github
* Love all those commits
* Say more in each commit - as much as you can in 30 seconds or so.

## Functional Expectations

* Exceptional: You completed Phase Three and did something with Phase Four.
