## Notes/What To Work On:

### OVERVIEW
- YAY for getting through all of Phase III AND writing easy-to-follow vanilla JS!!! 

### DESIGN
- Links not redirecting on cards
- Give users error messaging to indicate that both fields must be submitted in order to make a card. Also - syntax error on Line 66 allows edge cases where cards can be created without both fields completed
- Pretty responsive! Mobile is too big... minor adjustments on sizing there and fiddling with the header throughout. Err on the side of being nit-picky

### HTML
- Good indendation and spacing. YAY for ARIA, alt, labels. Add a lang attribute to HTML
- Looks good overall

### CSS
- YAY for idiomatic CSS!!!
- Totally okay to use reset or normalize files even though we hadn't covered these topics before this project launched -- would highly recommend using them. This helps you avoid declarations where you are undoing base default styles... also increases cross-browser compatibility

### JS 
- Love that you used vanilla JS for this project to solidify your learning!!! 
- Most of the naming looks good - `readySecondaryButtons` threw me off initially, though
- Good use of paramenters/arguments to avoid some global vars
- Good job breaking apart functionality

### GIT/GITHUB
- Like that you are using branches to work on features. 
- Capitalize first letter in commits. Stay concise and descriptive with commit descriptions
