## Notes/What To Work On:

### comp
* Super close to being fully responsive
* Try doing mobile first next project

### html
* Add labels to all input fields!

### css
* Consider adding comments for different sections of your css
* Use convention for organization within blocks - ie. idiomatic or alphabetized

### js
* Consider using template literals to simplify appending things to the dom
* Break out similar blocks of code into their own functions and pass dynamic pieces as arguments
* reuse named functions for event listeners

### git/github
* Say more in each commit - as much as you can in 30 seconds or so.
