## Notes/What To Work On:

* Pay more attention to the spec - make sure everything is done exactly as specified
* Time boxing - once you've been on a problem for 30 minutes, ask for help
* Work on technical vocab while pairing

### comp
* Would like to see some responsiveness
* Consider doing mobile first for next project

### html 
* remove unneeded code
* add labels to input elements

### css 
* good job idiomatically organizing in blocks
* Could consider adding comments for different sections of css for better organization

### js
* Good job starting over after struggling on a file with unneccessary code.
* Go back to spec and check things off in the future to make sure that you're meeting the spec

### git/github
* Would like to see more commits and more commits. For a project of this length at least 50 or so.
* Would like to see an even number of commits from each contributor
