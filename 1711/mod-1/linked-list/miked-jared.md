## Notes/What To Work On:

### comp
* Nice work! 
* Read and delete buttons could be a bit bigger

### html
* Use form element for accessibility reasons
* Use labels for all inputs

### css
* Consider adding comments for different sections of your css
* Use convention for organization within blocks - ie. idiomatic or alphabetized
* Get rid of all of the empty lines at the bottom of the file!

### js
* Use action like words for function names - ie. countRead instead of readCount
* Consider using template literals for appending html to page

### git/github
* Would like to see more verbose commit messages in the future and similar numbers of commits from each collaborator
