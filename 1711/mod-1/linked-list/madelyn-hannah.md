## Notes/What To Work On:

- UI is a little squirrely as the screen size is reduced
- some broken layout elements on mobile
- good use of github, using issues and PRs
- CSS could use a refactor
- avoid percentages for margin and padding
- absolutely positioned elements that likely don't need to be absolutely positioned
