#### MVP
On load, the application displays a random recipe, a simple text search field and buttons to display drinks filtered by category, ingredient, or alcoholic content.

#### Nice To Haves
Display a checklist of ingredients where users may select ingredients on-hand.  On submit, a list of drinks containing the selected ingredients will be displayed.

Users may select desired recipes and print a shopping list of required ingredients.

Users may create an account to save favorite drinks, wishlists (for ingredients), and store/maintain an inventory of on-hand ingredients.

In addition to having a printable shopping list, user is provided a link to an online merchant (Amazon?) with a shopping cart pre-populated with required ingredients.

#### Biggest Challenges
Filtering recipes based on multiple criteria (ingredients).  Inclusive vs exclusive search?
