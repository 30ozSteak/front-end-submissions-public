## Project Name:
The Bar Builder

#### Check In: 3

#### Progress made?
* Moved components to individual routes
* Created page titles on all components
* Styled entire app
* Sorted all select options and lists
* Added a few tests

#### What deliverables still need to be completed from your last checkin?
* Releveance filters.  By default, My Bar Menu should only display drinks with ingredients listed in My Inventory.  If project time allows, user will have option to include recipes that require one or two additional ingredients.
* Combined filters.  The API returns a filtered array of recipes based on queried selection.  This is a blessing and a curse.  It makes individual queries extremely simple.  However, to combine more than one filter is proving more difficult than I originally estimated.

#### Next Steps?
* Fix bugs in combined filters or rewrite the function(s) entirely.
* Update My Bar Menu filter to exclude ingredients not checked in inventory.
* Move recipe filters out of Header component.
* Add/update/finish tests.

#### What are your concerns (if any)
* Complexity of combined filters with given API functionality.
* Writing and passing tests

#### Deliverables for next checkin:
