#### Order Of Attack

Fetching data from API and setting up user information
set up logic for passing the information in-store/actions/reducers
move fetch call into middleware/sagas
fetch on search
setup routes and paths on button clicks
displaying information
saving user information in a login
loading image when fetching data

#### MVP
allow the user to be able to click on different areas of interest, company information, rockets, launches, and capsules data.
the user can bookmark information, to check again at a later date.
the user can save information and is reloaded on page load

Use youtube API to pull in video content of space-x launches.


#### Biggest Challenges
getting content to be fun and interactive. 
making the project scalable.
working with saga or middleware.
