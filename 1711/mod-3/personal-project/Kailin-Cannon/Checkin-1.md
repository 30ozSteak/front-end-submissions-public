#### Order Of Attack  
- API calls being made in general
- API calls cleaned into desired format to return. In this order: Films, People, then Locations
- Write API-calls tests
- Put API cleaned objects in Redux Store
- Start making React components. Get Films displayed on page
- Bring in React-Router, work on User Sign-in/Signup
- User favorites with Router
- Put user favorites in Store
- Put user and their favorites in LocalStorage
- Bring in People data to display & favorite
- Bring in Locations data to display & favorite
- Write a lot of tests for React/Redux stuff
- Do CSS


#### MVP  
- A user can sign in, view films, favorite films on the main /films page and go to /favorites and view their favorite films. User data persists through a reload. 

#### Nice To Haves  
Some sort of search or filter that covers all 3 categories (films/people/locations)

#### Biggest Challenges  
- Nested fetch calls
- React-Router makes no sense
- Tests are scary
