## Project Name:
Wizard Armory
#### Check In: 2

#### Progress made?
-UI added
-Broke down different colors into objects in the store tree with cards for colors in separate arrays so fetch calls do not need to be made everytime

#### What deliverables still need to be completed from your last checkin?
-Still having some trouble rendering each color: app crashing when switch from color to color
#### Next Steps?
-Finish logic to render each color, possible switch statement...
-set up backend via firebase, possibly just build the backend?
#### What are your concerns (if any)
-Need to decide if firebase would be more expedient than just building a backend?
-Not completely sure how to solve rendering problem to get app fully functional again...
#### Deliverables for next checkin:
