## Deliverables

-setting up store so only 5 api calls are made total
-do work on UI tonight
-set up firebase backend and authentication
-user should be able to authenticate
-deck should be able to be saved to firebase
ie deck = {
  userId,
  array of card ids
}
-user authentication should return a user id, and based on the user id, get id of decks which will also be stored in firebase

# for next time:

-Better Rug background image (pixelated on bigger screens)

-Border Radius on cards--get rid of brown color and box shadow on hover

-put sign in/out closer together, possibly in upper-right corner

-If signed in, should only see sign out button

-UI to indicated card has been selected

-Hide form when in MyDeck

-Redirect on sign in
