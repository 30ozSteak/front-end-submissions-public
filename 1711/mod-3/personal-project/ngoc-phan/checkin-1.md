### Check-In-1

### Project Pitch:
This application will give the user the ability to search through recipes and favorite the recipes. After the user logs back in, they will have the ability to see which recipes they have favorited. They will also be given the ability to just search through random suggestions if they have nothing in mind. This app will be for those who wants a little bit of direction when it comes to planning or cooking their next meal.
