### Project Name: Feed Me

### Check In: 2

### Progress made?
- Router and Redux hooked up
- recipes and favorites are in state
- Data is fetched, cleaned and displays
- Actions, reducters and come containers are tested

### What deliverables still need to be completed from your last checkin?
- state has overlapping information

### Next Steps?
- Signin and logout components
- get the selected class on cards to work and not select all the cards

### What are your concerns (if any)
- incomplete testing
- middleware and firebase will take up too much time and require too much refractoring

### Deliverables for next checkin:

* Firebase
* TEST!!!
* Be able to get more than 10 recipes
* Start working on filter
* Just put recipe ids in favorite array
