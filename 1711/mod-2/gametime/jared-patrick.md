# Instructor Evaluation Points: Game Time
# Instructor: Brittany


### Functional Expectations

* 4 - Application is fully playable and exceeds the expectations set by instructors

* Minus the memory leak (which is not a detached DOM node like I expected, but still couldn't track it down), the application is perfectly playable.

### User Interface

* 3 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality.

* Teensy bit of jankiness with animations/shapes but clearly a lot of effort went into creating the UI!

### Testing

* 4 - Project has a running test suite that exercises the application at multiple levels. The test suite covers almost all aspects of the application and uses mocks and stubs when appropriate. ESLint shows 0 complaints.


### JavaScript Style

* 3 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.


### Workflow

* 3 - The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.
