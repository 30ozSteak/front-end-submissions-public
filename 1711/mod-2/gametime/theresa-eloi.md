### Functional Expectations

* 3 - Application is fully playable without crashes or bugs

### User Interface

* 3 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality.

* Would be nice to be able to auto-level-up after winning level one.

### Testing

* 3 - Project has a running test suite that tests multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All functionality is covered by tests. The application makes some use of integration testing. ESLint shows < 5 complaints.


### JavaScript Style

* 3 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.


### Workflow

* 3 - The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.
