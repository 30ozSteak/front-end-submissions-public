### Evaluator comments:
* You should import and export your trie in your index file
* In `insert` you can combine your nested if statements.
```
if(currentNode[currentLetter].completeWord === false) {
  if(!lettersArray.length) {
    this.wordCounter++;
    currentNode[currentLetter].completeWord = word;
  }
}
```
to
```
if(currentNode[currentLetter].completeWord === false && !lettersArray.length) {
  this.wordCounter++;
  currentNode[currentLetter].completeWord = word; 
}
```

* To check if an object has a property, try using `Object.hasOwnProperty('propName');` instead of `Object.keys(currentNode).find(letter => letter === currentLetter)`
* In your delete, you should check to make sure that a node is a complete word before decrementing the word count.
