### Evaluator comments:
* Test suite is a bit thin - in the future, be sure to have very explicit, very atomic tests that cover the happy and sad paths

### 1. Fundamental JavaScript & Style

* 3:  Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring


### 2. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

### 4. Functional Expectations

* 3: Application meets all requirements as laid out per the specification.
