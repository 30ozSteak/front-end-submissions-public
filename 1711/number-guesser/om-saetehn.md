## Notes/What To Work On:

* Loved the user feedback messages

### comp 
* Need a little more attention to detail ie. everything should be as wide as the input
* Font weights look good
* Pay more attention to whitespace and spacing

### html
* Body was within head, keep separate
* Always have scripts at the bottom of the body
* Really nice job with tabbing
* Use forms
* Use kabob case for classes and ids

### css
* Great style! Could pull comma separated declarations into one class use ids to override styles for specific elements

### js 
* Avoid nested if statements
* Write more action like names for functions and be a little more explicit and verbose with var names
