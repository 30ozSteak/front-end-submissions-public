## Notes/What To Work On:

* In future projects, push yourself further. You easily could've gotten through phase 4!
* Make sure that the buttons are actually disabled and not only giving the appearance

### html 
* Use forms and labels for all inputs

### css
* Try adding comments for better organization ie. nav styles, form styles, etc.

### js
* Use semicolons
* Try using more local variables and pass them around as arguments
* Could pull out the reassignment of guessFeedback into a function that takes an argument of the message to be displayed
