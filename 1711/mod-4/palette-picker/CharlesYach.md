## Completion

#### Were you able to complete the base functionality?

1) I was not able to click on the name of a saved pallet to show the colors in the generator. My delete event listener was triggering instead. I thought I was being specific with the selector, but I guess not. More research needed.

2) A user cannot save a pallete without a project name and there is no error message.

3) Sometimes there is a catch error alert when posting a pallet. Inconsistant. Need time to narrow down the cause.

#### Which extensions, if any, did you complete?

None

# Code Quality

#### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub that you are proud of
[happy code](https://github.com/CharlesY712/pallet-picker/blob/59f56cbeb91b27522eb852f20e9e08d06eead39c/public/js/scripts.js#L136-L160)

* Why were you proud of this piece of code?

I thought I had screwed my self by toggling the inner text of the color windows. By using .css('background-color') I was still able to grab the value.

#### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub that you feel not great about
[sad code](https://github.com/CharlesY712/pallet-picker/blob/59f56cbeb91b27522eb852f20e9e08d06eead39c/public/js/scripts.js#L8-L18)

* Why do you feel not awesome about the code? What challenges did you face trying to write/refactor it?

This is not my code. I had no idea how to write a random color generator so I grabbed this off stackOverflow. I would feel better had I been the one to figure it out.

#### Attach a screenshot or paste the output from your terminal of the result of your test-suite running.

#### Link to Design Inspiration

* Show us what you used as design inspiration (another color picker site, a dribbble UI element, a user flow, etc.) and explain what you stole from it

There was no design inspiration. There was no design at all :(

#### Please feel free to ask any other questions or make any other statements below!

Anything else you wanna say!

I'm very embarrassed, dissapointed, and ashamed that I did not have this finished before graduation. Shame on me.
