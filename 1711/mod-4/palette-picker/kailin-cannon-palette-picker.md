# Palette Picker Submission Form

[Project Spec](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/palette-picker.html)

# Basics

#### Link to the GitHub Repository for the Project
[palette-picker](https://github.com/Kc2693/palette-picker)

#### Link to the Deployed Application
[heroku](https://kc-palette-picker.herokuapp.com/)

#### Link to your annotated server file
Did not get a chance to annote server file.

## Completion

#### Were you able to complete the base functionality?

No. Repo has a list of github issues for missing functionality. I didn't get a chance to implement the lock on colors, unique folder names, clicking on a project palette to generate it. Additionally I still have things requiring a page reload.

#### Which extensions, if any, did you complete?

# Code Quality

#### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub that you are proud of
[happy code](https://github.com/Kc2693/palette-picker/blob/29d6e33135cd4fcd28eb08170efb6eef60a27add/public/js/scripts.js#L79)

* Why were you proud of this piece of code?
It took me a long time to get right. I was initially trying to do everything (project div, palette divs inside that, and individual color palettes in each palette div) in one function and it wasn't working the way I wanted it to. Now it's three function and a returned template literal instead of using 'appendTo' which is working much better.

#### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub that you feel not great about
[sad code](https://github.com/Kc2693/palette-picker/blob/29d6e33135cd4fcd28eb08170efb6eef60a27add/test/test.js#L28)

I never figured out how to reset tables/database before each test. 

#### Attach a screenshot or paste the output from your terminal of the result of your test-suite running.
My test suite isn't running properly. It isn't migrating files before each test.

#### Please feel free to ask any other questions or make any other statements below!

I'm going to try to keep working on this on an 'after-deadline' branch, but I'm not sure how to get my tests working on my own.
