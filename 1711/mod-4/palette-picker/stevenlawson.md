## Completion

#### Were you able to complete the base functionality?

Not quite: Most backend functionality is there, except for deletion.
The names are appending to the select dropdown, and appending to the page, but their associated color palettes are not. jQuery really threw me for a loop on this one.

#### Which extensions, if any, did you complete?

# Code Quality

* Why were you proud of this piece of code?
I am proud of this code because I was able to use jQuery to iterate over the project names.

#### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub that you feel not great about
[sad code](https://github.com/stevenleelawson/Palette-Picker/blob/2005f5856253460b1ca25e836716e45e92bf3f7e/public/js/scripts.js#L24-L29)
