# Code Quality

#### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub that you are proud of
[happy code](https://github.com/mmdberg/Palette-Picker/blob/87d19c62796f6df7a4dfed3946154a9977f2f654/public/js/scripts.js#L15-L18)

* Why were you proud of this piece of code?
I am proud of this piece of code because I originally was making a random color 1 through 5 and adding each individually to the color array and it was ugly and long. I like how clean this part of my code turned out to be.

#### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub that you feel not great about
[sad code](https://github.com/mmdberg/Palette-Picker/blob/87d19c62796f6df7a4dfed3946154a9977f2f654/public/css/styles.css#L108-L111)

* Why do you feel not awesome about the code? What challenges did you face trying to write/refactor it?
I wanted to style the dropdown menu, but could not figure out how to change it. I tried targeting the parent of the option menu and the children but could not get it to change and look pretty.
