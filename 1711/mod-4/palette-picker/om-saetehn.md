## Completion

#### Were you able to complete the base functionality?
The pallete can be generated, and remains locked during ramdomization if selected. Users can create new palette corresponding with the project and the data is retrieved from server after refresh.

Following functionalities are missing: 
1) can delete project and palette from page, although not yet on server
2) unspotted syntax error in test file, not passing or running properly

#### Which extensions, if any, did you complete?
N/A

Assigning variables from both fetches to return object key for appending.

#### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub that you feel not great about
[sad code](https://github.com/chunktooth/palette-picker/blob/9fbf47238dc81a69b614944507c3cdc1e886a0ca/public/script.js#L106)

Grabbing a selector from the DOM element can be achieved ways and it can be tricky. I was recommended trying $.map() selector and passing in two arguments.
