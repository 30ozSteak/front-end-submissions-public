## Completion

#### Were you able to complete the base functionality?

Yes, but due to the time constraints I had to throw in alerts for user messages which is ugly. I also would like to change how the palettes and projects are positioned. I did those day one and flexed them. I have add a lot of html tags in between since then and now I can't figure out where to fix the problem since I'm interacting with the dom in such a way that makes the css harder to navigate. I'm sure with some more time I can remedy this issue. 

#### Which extensions, if any, did you complete?

none.

# Code Quality

#### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub that you are proud of
[happy code](https://github.com/nphan24/palette-picker/blob/2d4d0a751fda960413b5b8cabb03f29bc42a677b/public/scripts.js#L94-L99)

* Why were you proud of this piece of code?
I was proud because it took me a while to figure out how to make the lock function work. It didn't come easily. I had to look through the docs for a while and tried multiple things before I got it working. It was a little victory but it felt good.

#### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub that you feel not great about
[sad code](https://github.com/nphan24/palette-picker/blob/2d4d0a751fda960413b5b8cabb03f29bc42a677b/public/scripts.js#L167-L176)

* Why do you feel not awesome about the code? What challenges did you face trying to write/refactor it?

There weren't any challenges here. I just had to throw it in because I ran out of time and would like to refractor it. It's the same code for each color hex. I refractor it into an array and then loop over the array to perform the task.

#### Attach a screenshot or paste the output from your terminal of the result of your test-suite running.

[test suite](https://scontent-dfw5-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/31945146_10216745930224092_2283154634019176448_o.jpg?_nc_cat=0&oh=10a9c1a7eabfe4cc89e12d337c74fa73&oe=5B58C2BA)

#### Link to Design Inspiration

[Dribble Inspiration](https://dribbble.com/shots/4534143-Digital-agency)

* Show us what you used as design inspiration (another color picker site, a dribbble UI element, a user flow, etc.) and explain what you stole from it

I liked the color contrast in this dribble. I liked the black background and the white separating the colors. They're natural colors so I felt like it makes the color palette stands out more.

#### Please feel free to ask any other questions or make any other statements below!

Anything else you wanna say!

This was a fun experience getting to see how the backend and frontend communicates with each other.
