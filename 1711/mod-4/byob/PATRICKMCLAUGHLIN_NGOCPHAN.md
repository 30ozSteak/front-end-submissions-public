# Code Quality

#### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub that you are proud of
[happy code](https://github.com/patrickmc21/harry-potter-BYOB/blob/7f5c9d4480ba1c149db1596302782bf82e87ff1d/scraped-data/characters.js#L1-L113)

* Why were you proud of this piece of code?

This was a pretty challenging aspect of the project. We wanted to scrape data from several different pages of the pottermore site, without creating 40 different nightmare files. Doing that in a single process was rewarding.

#### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub that you feel not great about
[sad code](https://github.com/patrickmc21/harry-potter-BYOB/blob/7f5c9d4480ba1c149db1596302782bf82e87ff1d/public/scripts.js#L1-L34)

* Why do you feel not awesome about the code? What challenges did you face trying to write/refactor it?

Nothing really bad about this code, just seems like a sad amount of client side code. 

#### Attach a screenshot or paste the output from your terminal of the result of your test-suite running.
