Comments:

* Struggled with talking through thought process/articulation without reverting back to code. More pracitce with whiteboarding would be good

## 1. Process

2.75: Developer has strategies for approaching complex challenges. Can explain thought process and strategy when prompted but might need a bit more guidance than expected.

## 2. Fundamental JavaScript & Style


3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

## 3. Test-Driven Development & Code Sanitation

2.75: Application makes some use of tests, but the coverage is insufficient. Linting shows 1 complaint.

- ESLint shows `âœ– 1 problem (1 error, 0 warnings)` Good job linting!
- Testing for `populate` should live in its own `describe` block for that method
- Testing for `insert` should be more verbose - currently only testing for the insertion of a single word - there should be testing to insure that multiple words can be instered.
- Add testing for `endNode` property being set to `true` when word is complete


## 4. Functional Expectations

3: Application meets all requirements as laid out per the specification.
