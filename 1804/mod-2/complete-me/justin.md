Comments:
* Did not make it to the coding portion of the problem-solving process. Was unclear on how to get started and struggled to respond to prompting guidance or questions.


## 1. Process

1: Developer does not demonstrate any strategy or process. No meaningful code is written and developer cannot articulate their process.

## 2. Fundamental JavaScript & Style

2.5: Application runs but the code has unnecessary or poorly named variables - needs refactoring

- Naming is hard to follow at times

## 3. Test-Driven Development & Code Sanitation

2: Application makes some use of tests, but the coverage is insufficient. Linting shows more than ten complaints.

- ESLint shows `35 problems (21 errors, 14 warnings)`
- Add tests to test all default properties of `Node` class
- Would like to see more verbose testing for `insert` - testing with multiple words and checking children nodes to be sure trie is building out correctly.
- Add tests for `suggest` - what happens when there are no suggestions to return based on what is entered?
- No tests for `find`


## 4. Functional Expectations

3: Application meets all requirements as laid out per the specification.
