### Evaluator: Pamela Lovett


Comments:
* Good job with whiteboarding insert and talking through the process. Easy to follow along.
* Unable to delete/re-implement the suggest method fully. Too attached to the code/patterns implemented on actual project which caused issues with trying to implement method live, despite prompting and guidance. 

## 1. Process

2: Developer demonstrates a haphazard, trial and error approach, without clear strategy. Developer does not articulate thought process clearly, and cannot explain the problem-solving strategies they utilized.

## 2. Fundamental JavaScript & Style

3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

## 3. Test-Driven Development & Code Sanitation

3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality.  Linting shows 0 complaints.

- ESLint shows no errors!
- Testing for `insert` could be more verbose - add tests for inserting multiple words

## 4. Functional Expectations

4: Application meets all requirements, and implements one extension properly.

- `Delete` implemented and tested with multiple inserts
