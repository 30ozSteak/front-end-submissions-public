Comments:
* Articulation could use improvement; however, was able to logically talk through insert on the whiteboard
* Unable to delete/re-implement the suggest method fully. Too attached to the code/patterns implemented on actual project which caused issues with trying to implement method live, despite prompting and guidance. 


## 1. Process

2: Developer does not articulate thought process clearly, and cannot explain the problem-solving strategies they utilized.

## 2. Fundamental JavaScript & Style


3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

## 3. Test-Driven Development & Code Sanitation

2.5: Application makes some use of tests, but the coverage is insufficient. Linting shows more than ten complaints.

- No commented out code/tests should be living on your master branch. Lots of console logs and empty `it` blocks for incomplete testing
- ESLint shows `45 problems (17 errors, 28 warnings)`

## 4. Functional Expectations

4: Application meets all requirements, and implements one extension properly.

- `Delete` implemented with testing
