Comments:
* Good articulation and problem-solving process, though latches onto code a little too quickly. (Whiteboarding shouldn't include any code, be more high-level with it.) I'd like to see you move away from the keyboard a bit more after you start coding, and get back to talking through things/whiteboarding rather than continuing to write out code. 


## 1. Process

3: Developer has strategies for approaching complex challenges. Can explain thought process and strategy when prompted.

## 2. Fundamental JavaScript & Style

3.5: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

## 3. Test-Driven Development & Code Sanitation

3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality. Linting shows more than ten complaints.

- ESLint shows `19 problems (19 errors, 0 warnings)`
- `it` blocks should describe what you are testing and should use natural language. Don't order your sentences as object-subject-verb in your `it` block descriptions. Although amusing, it just makes it difficult for others to jump into your tests.
- Would like to see more verbose testing for `insert` - testing with multiple words and checking children nodes to be sure trie is building out correctly.

## 4. Functional Expectations

4: Application meets all requirements, and implements one extension properly.

- Implementation and testing for `delete` incorporated
