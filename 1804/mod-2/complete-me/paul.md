Comments:
* Good articulation and problem-solving process, though latches onto code a little too quickly. (Whiteboarding shouldn't include any code, be more high-level with it.) I'd like to see you move away from the keyboard a bit more after you start coding, and get back to talking through things/whiteboarding rather than continuing to write out code.
