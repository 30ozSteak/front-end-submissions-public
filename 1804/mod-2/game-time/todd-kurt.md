# Game Time
* Students: Todd & Kurt
* Evaluator: Nathaniel

Comments:
* Remove classes you are not using (e.g. Block)
* The order of the arguments you pass into `super` should be the same order as the parameter order in the parent class (e.g. Apple -> super(height, width) should be super(x, y, height, width))
* If you only have one snake, name it snake vs firstSnake

### Functional Expectations

* 3 - Application is fully playable without crashes or bugs

### User Interface

* 3 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality.

### Testing

* 3 - Project has a running test suite that tests multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All functionality is covered by tests. The application makes some use of integration testing. ESLint shows < 5 complaints.

### JavaScript Style & OOP

* 3 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing. Application is organized into classes (and correctly uses inheritance) with some misplaced logic and no major bugs. Business-logic code is mostly separated from view-related code. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what each line of code is doing.

### Workflow

Work on using more detailed commit messages

* 2 - The developer/team makes large commits covering multiple features that make it difficult for the evaluator to determine the evolution of the application. The team does not utilize a planning tool or equitable pairing practices. One or both members do not contribute meaningfully to the application.
