## Students: Ben and Brandon C 
## Evaluator: Pamela Lovett
## Notes/What To Work On:

## OVERALL
- Good job doing DTR and working remotely
- Through part of Phase III
- No need for rounded inputs/buttons
- Comp recreation looks good overall - some polishing and attention to spacing needed
- Search is a little buggy with upper vs lowercase
- `Completed Task` functionality not complete

## GIT/GITHUB
- More commits
- Work on being descriptive with your commit messages

## HTML
- Make accessible - add labels to your inputs, run through a screenreader, etc

## CSS
- Organize rules and use comments - parts of CSS are hard to follwo
- Several places with duplicated code from original codebase
- Avoid IDs as selectors in CSS due to specificity

## JS
- Great job breaking functionality apart and getting rid of global vars, anonymous functions, broken code
- Naming is easy to follow
- Some areas of duplication that could be refactored
