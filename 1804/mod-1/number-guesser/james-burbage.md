HTML
* naming conventions - guess-input instead of input-box
* add aria-label to inputs

* Dry it up!
* Pull duplicate declaration blocks into a more broad class, and override where necessary

JS
* Say more in naming conventions - more descriptive and make sure that functions read like an action
* Check out style guides
