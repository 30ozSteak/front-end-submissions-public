## Evaluator: David Whitaker
## Notes/What To Work On:

HTML
* Use forms! Use aria-labels!
* Switch to kabob-case

CSS
* use classes as standalone in declaration
* pull duplicate declaration blocks into a more broad class to dry things up
* May be easier to use percentages as widths

JS
* Leverage else ifs - always have an else for the catch all
* be more verbose and descriptive in naming conventions
* leverage console logs more and know what returns are doing (they will return a value from a function, and are only really necessary if we want to store the return value
