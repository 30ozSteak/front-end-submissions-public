## Notes/What To Work On:

HTML 
- Communicate layout and grouping of content
- Use Aria labels for your forms

CSS 
- Opportunities to dry up code - move text-align: center to a higher up class to apply to more elements

JS 
- Naming is important - "minn" and "maxx" are not ideal - instead use userMin and userMax
- Leverage parameters to dry up functions that do similar things to different items
- Enable buttons can be a single function that passes in button parameters
- Separate displaying data functionality from updating data logic
