- Through Phase III

- Some jarring of elements w/dynamic feedback that should be addressed 
- Run through a screenreader
- Avoid ids as in CSS due to specificity
- Look into a methodology like [SMACSS](https://smacss.com/book/categorizing) for organizing CSS
- Look into organizing your CSS declarations [idiomatically](https://github.com/necolas/idiomatic-css)
- Nice job talking through your JS
