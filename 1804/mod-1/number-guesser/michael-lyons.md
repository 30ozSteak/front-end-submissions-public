## Student: Michael
## Evaluator: Leta Keane
## Notes/What To Work On:

HTML 
- Good use of ARIA tags
- Communicates structure well
- Thoughtful, legal usage of div :slightly_smiling_face:

CSS 
- Nice layout, very little redundancy

JS 
- Leverage parameters (enable and disable buttons - pass in the boolean instead and turn it into a single function!)
- Reduce repetition in if/else statement? Just an opportunity to refactor if you wanted to
