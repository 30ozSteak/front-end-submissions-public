## Student: Tom and Ben
## Evaluator: Pamela Lovett
## Notes/What To Work On:

- Make sure to do a DTR every project

## Functionality
- Good job with getting through all the phases - but remember to stay within the scope of the project spec

## Comp Recreation/Design
- Goal should be to recreate the comp in a pixel-perfect fashion - app does not do this for majority of screen sizes. 

## Git/GitHub
- Be sure that you are following commit conventions (i.e., first letter capitalized, concise but verbose, etc)
- Would like to see more commits

## HTML
- Add labels for inputs
- Add lang for `HTML` tag
- Send through screenreader
- Good nesting/formatting

## CSS
- Nice job using `box-sizing: border-box`
- Declarations in selectors should be organized alphabetically or [clustered by related properties](https://github.com/necolas/idiomatic-css)
- Keep your [CSS selectors short](https://csswizardry.com/2012/05/keep-your-css-selectors-short/)

## JS
- Remove commented out code
- Opportunities for refactoring with duplicated lines and breaking apart functionality
- Work on naming
- Returning boolean in `else` on lines 41-43 not necessary
- Nice job attempting to dig into regex code
