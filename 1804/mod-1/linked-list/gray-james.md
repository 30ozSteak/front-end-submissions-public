## Student: Gray and James
## Evaluator: Pamela Lovett
## Notes/What To Work On:


## Functionality
- No error messaging if one field is empty. No indication that `http://` is needed for URL validation.
(Through Phase IV) 

## Comp Recreation/Design
- Overall good recreation of the comp
- Make sure button/counter placement looks intentional
- Minor things to polish

## Git/GitHub
- Good job with making verbose, detailed commits
- Nice job working on feature branches

## HTML
- Add labels to your inputs
- Run through a screenreader
- Do not add classes before you need them

## CSS
- Nice job alphabetizing declarations
- Look into [idiomatic CSS](https://github.com/necolas/idiomatic-css)
- Keep your [CSS selectors short](https://csswizardry.com/2012/05/keep-your-css-selectors-short/)

## JS
- Delete code that is not dealing with current spec
- Take advantage that you are using function declarations and not expressions by placing functions called on page load at the top of your file
- Simplify, simplify, simplify - take the Dieter Rams approach to writing your JS. Less is often more, as we discussed
