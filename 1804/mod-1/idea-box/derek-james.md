## Student: Derek and James
## Evaluator: David Whitaker
## Notes/What To Work On:

* Solid comp implementation

### HTML
* Good use of aria-labels - really only needed on inputs though

### CSS
* Consider adding organizational comments
* Consider pulling duplicate declarations into a more broad class rule
* Make sure you're using google fonts correctly

### JS
* Pseudo code more and possibly use a checklist
* Separate the data model from the markup - ie. Idea instead of IdeaCard

## Functional Expectations

* Novice  Application meets all of the basic functional expectations of create, edit, delete, persist in local storage.

## HTML

## Accessibility

* Proficient  Employs detailed accessibility practices throughout markup, especially in forms and can speak to decisions made in accessibility choices as it relates to specific accessibility concerns.

## Style

* Proficient  Crafts lean, efficient markup that is easy to read and follow across naming conventions, structure, and solid formatting that follows industry best practices.

## CSS

## Structure of Code

* Advanced Beginner Can cleanly and logically organize CSS rules according to similar categories (i.e. typography, layout, components), and then logically organize the remaining CSS rules based on flow of the markup. Organizes properties within rules alphabetically.
* Proficient  Leverages cascading styles and CSS specificity rules to create more complex targeting of elements in order to reduce, reuse, share styles across elements. Organizes properties within rules based upon industry standard principles of writing consistent, idiomatic CSS.

## Implementation

* Advanced Beginner Can articulate the differences between the approaches of absolute/relative positioning, flex-box, floats, and can appropriately apply the approaches to solve a variety of layout problems.
* Proficient  Develops layouts that work cross-browser, are responsive, and can logically defend the choices made in implementation approach for layout.

## JAVASCRIPT

## Data Types

* Advanced Beginner Can diagnose when issues of data-type mismatch are present and appropriately redirect their coding and/or research efforts accordingly to solve the problem.

## Conditional Logic

* Advanced Beginner Uses if/else statements, but there are multiple levels of nesting, which makes the paths through the code difficult to follow. Understands what is “truthy” and “falsey” in JavaScript.

## Functions & Scope

* Advanced Beginner Developer is comfortable using multiple arguments to pass data into functions. Understands how variables are scoped at the function level and global level. Functions are named descriptively. Knows when and why to use return in a function.

## Arrays

* Novice  Can create array and use array indexing to extract data from array or modify array. Comfortable using arrays to store simple data types: numbers, booleans, or strings.
* Advanced Beginner Can modify arrays by adding or removing specific elements - uses array methods such as push or shift. Can use a for loop to iterate through array.

## Objects & Prototypes

* Advanced Beginner Can use object constructor functions and is comfortable with extracting values of properties on different object instances.

## DOM Manipulation

* Novice  Can articulate what the DOM is and can effectively target elements in vanilla JavaScript via class, id, or tag.
* Advanced Beginner Can add event listeners and create small functions that execute on events, can leverage the event object appropriately, and can articulate the what/why/how of jQuery.

## Style

* Advanced Beginner Code shows strong effort toward organization, but suffers from long functions, unnecessary or poorly named variables, and requires significant refactoring. Application may have some duplication and minor bugs.
* Proficient  Code is logically organized, such that reader can easily follow the progression of the app because variable and function names are descriptive and follow a single responsibility approach. There are no major bugs and minimal duplication.

## GIT & GITHUB

## Git

* Advanced Beginner Can create branches and willingly attempts to incorporate branches into their workflow. Commits, while infrequent, are increased in volume and show improvements in description.

## Github

* Novice  Can articulate what GitHub is, how it is different from Git, and why it is important. Can comfortably push and/or pull changes from master.
* Advanced Beginner Can execute basic pull requests with context about changes in description. Can keep local and GitHub repositories in sync.

## DESIGN

## Comp Recreation

* Advanced Beginner Can accomplish about 50-75% of the large and small design details and can logically rework them on at least 1 breakpoint.
* Proficient  Developer captures the spirit and design intent of the comp. Some small details need polish to achieve a pixel-perfect match to the comp, but developer is clearly mindful of details and has made a conscious and careful effort to match the comp. Any design decisions left open to interpretation are handled thoughtfully and are well executed, but are more noticeable and/or unintuitive than they would be if the designer had provided the solution, or may not be totally seamless during screen-size transitions.

## PAIRING

## Collaboration

* Advanced Beginner Can identify deltas in skill level and collaborate on methods whereby both pairs can share equitably in the workload. Can revisit the DTR to address changes that arise, and/or simply to keep one another reminded of the working plan.
* Proficient  Can diplomatically handle issues that arise between the pair through respectful, focused, targeted feedback and implement changes to positively adapt the working relationship and keep the project on track. Can effectively implement tactics to support their partner’s learning and project goals, while also honoring their own personal learning and project goals, should the two be different or at different levels due to skill delta.

## TERMINOLOGY

## Technical Vocab

* Advanced Beginner Can articulate what is going on in the overall codebase and uses the correct terminology some of the time.
* Proficient Can articulate what is going on in the codebase, line by line, using the correct terminology most of the time. Developer can speak to and answer questions that utilize technical vocabulary.
