# Code Quality

#### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub that you are proud of

[happy code](https://github.com/kmiller9393/palette-picker/blob/master/server.js)

Overall, pretty happy with my backend code (server.js)

- Why were you proud of this piece of code?

I was proud of this code, because I feel like I accomplished what was necessary with as few endpoints as possible.

#### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub that you feel not great about

[sad code](https://github.com/kmiller9393/palette-picker/blob/master/public/js/index.js)

- Why do you feel not awesome about the code? What challenges did you face trying to write/refactor it?

If you scroll down to line 218 and look at my setPaletteView function, I was unhappy with this code, because it's an extremely long function (Prettier doesn't help) and I could have probably broken this function out into several other functions.
