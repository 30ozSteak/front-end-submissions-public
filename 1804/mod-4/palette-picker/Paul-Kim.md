* Why were you proud of this piece of code?

I learned how complex and sophisticated programming a keyboard is.  It was a big struggle but very fun to do.

#### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub that you feel not great about
[sad code]()

- I Did not make it responsive
- Code is very dense

* Why do you feel not awesome about the code? What challenges did you face trying to write/refactor it?

Refreshing myself on JQuery took a lot of time.  Made a lot of errors along the way and acknowledge that theres alot of unnecessary code.  This affected my time to make the app responsive
