## Completion

#### Were you able to complete the base functionality?

Yes, But i was not able to get the color palettes to generate a matching set of colors (extension). So i removed the random hex generator in favor of a more visually cohesive (yet far more limited) number of palettes. 

#### Link to an image of your wireframe(s)

[wireframes]() - Did not complete wireframes :( 

#### Which extensions, if any, did you complete?

I was able to complete the second extension which allows users a color picker or to enter their own hex value of a color.
I also added a search bar and the ability to edit the project and palette names. I also tested the back end with mocha / chai.

# Code Quality

#### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub that you are proud of
[happy code](https://github.com/benjaminpaige/palette-picker/blob/master/public/js/scripts.js)

* Why were you proud of this piece of code?

I enjoyed writing jquery again. it made dom manipulation a lot easier and it was fun using it to make things look nice. 

#### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub that you feel not great about
[sad code](https://github.com/benjaminpaige/palette-picker/blob/master/public/index.html)

* Why do you feel not awesome about the code? What challenges did you face trying to write/refactor it?

I feel like the html could have been more semantic and inputs could have had labels with them. I should have spent more time on it.

#### Link to Design Inspiration

[dribble](https://dribbble.com/shots/4932549-Pantone-Colors-The-New-Eclectic-Branding)

* Show us what you used as design inspiration (another color picker site, a dribbble UI element, a user flow, etc.) and explain what you stole from it.

I used this as inspiration for my color palettes. I liked the simplicity of it.

#### Please feel free to ask any other questions or make any other statements below!

Anything else you wanna say!

This was a really fun project. I am really happy with how it came out. I learned a lot and am excited about learning more about postgres in the next assignment.
