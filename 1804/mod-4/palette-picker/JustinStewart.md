## Completion

#### Were you able to complete the base functionality?

No, I got hung up on server side things quite often and they also took me a while to figure out. But the learning curve that has happened for me I think was way beneficial than getting easy help and all the functionality complete.

#### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub that you are proud of
[happy code](https://github.com/Jstewart3313/colorPicker/blob/master/server.js) 

* Why were you proud of this piece of code?

I think having a working server that is returning me something was a win. Being this is my first project working with the server side express && knex, I think if did this project again I would be able to complete all requirements.

#### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub that you feel not great about
[sad code](https://github.com/Jstewart3313/colorPicker/tree/master/public)

* Why do you feel not awesome about the code? What challenges did you face trying to write/refactor it?

I know my design eye is much better than this. I wanted to devote as much time to the back end stuff as possible and my front end definitely suffered because of it. Will be cleaning up in the future.

#### Link to Design Inspiration

* Show us what you used as design inspiration (another color picker site, a dribbble UI element, a user flow, etc.) and explain what you stole from it

I had idea's but was not able to implement due to time and prioritizing other functionality.

#### Please feel free to ask any other questions or make any other statements below!

I think the feeling lost in the beginning of this project raised a lot of unnecessary anxiety that caused me make mistakes that I wasn't able to catch early and often. But like I said above, me stuggling and figuring these things out gave me great perspective and a way better understanding of what was actually going on in my server file and within each end point. I think that going into this next project I have a much more solid understanding of express, and knex and how to set up both a server file and a DB using knex.

Anything else you wanna say!
