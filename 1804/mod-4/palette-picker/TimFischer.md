# Code Quality

#### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub that you are proud of
[happy code](https://github.com/TFisch/palette_picker/blob/7c01a3fed71e9c8cfe6cd6e3917d25fb0292e700/public/css/styles.css#L134-L148)

I was really stoked on how this logo turned out.

#### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub that you feel not great about
[sad code](https://github.com/TFisch/palette_picker/blob/7c01a3fed71e9c8cfe6cd6e3917d25fb0292e700/public/js/scripts.js#L220-L232)

I feel like this code is a little repetitve. It could be better refactored using the classnames npm package.

* Show us what you used as design inspiration (another color picker site, a dribbble UI element, a user flow, etc.) and explain what you stole from it

[Inspiration](https://dribbble.com/shots/2867961-Drop-down-menu)
