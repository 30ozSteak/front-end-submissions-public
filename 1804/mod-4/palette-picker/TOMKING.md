# Code Quality

#### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub that you are proud of
[happy code](https://github.com/tomkingkong/palette-picker/blob/31ca2555b7a035e4eeefc57ddc41729aa49f7aaa/public/js/scripts.js#L58-L63)

* Why were you proud of this piece of code?
It is funniest to me.

#### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub that you feel not great about
[sad code](https://github.com/tomkingkong/palette-picker/blob/31ca2555b7a035e4eeefc57ddc41729aa49f7aaa/public/js/scripts.js#L65-L97)

* Why do you feel not awesome about the code? What challenges did you face trying to write/refactor it?
Had to use setTimeout to avoid concurrency issues. Waaay too much going on here for one function, would need to break out into smaller pieces.

#### Link to Design Inspiration
[https://www.ea.com/games/bejeweled](https://www.ea.com/games/bejeweled)

* Show us what you used as design inspiration (another color picker site, a dribbble UI element, a user flow, etc.) and explain what you stole from it
I chose to steal the bejeweled style from EA, because they have been stealing users money for years.
