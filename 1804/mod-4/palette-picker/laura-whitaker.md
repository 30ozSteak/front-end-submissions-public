# Code Quality

#### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub that you are proud of
[happy code](https://github.com/laurakwhit/palette-picker/blob/server-comments/public/js/gem.js#L55)

* I was able to refactor this method to use a for loop that creates an array of colors that I can then use to generate a gem.

#### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub that you feel not great about
[sad code](https://github.com/laurakwhit/palette-picker/blob/server-comments/public/js/palettes.js#L66)

* I am setting each triangle of the diamond to a specific color. When trying to refactor to iterate over the triangles and the colors array, I ran into issues because I am not setting the same css property for each triangle... 

#### Link to Design Inspiration

* Used color palette from [coolors](https://coolors.co/).
* Liked smaller palette versions in this [project](https://dribbble.com/shots/3845170-Color-Hunt-s-New-Layout).
* Found [these](https://dribbble.com/shots/4564865-Diamonds-Best-Icons-of-the-Month) gem icons, which gave me the idea for making a gem shape.
