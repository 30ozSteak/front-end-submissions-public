## Project Name:  FlamesFinder
#### Check In:
#### Progress made? All weather APICalls completed, redux store populated with data from weather APICalls, initial UX/UI finished, linter added, and testing started
#### What deliverables still need to be completed from your last checkin? Nothing that I am aware of
#### Next Steps? Render the weather card on location search, add suggestions on location search, figure out how to convert XML to json to enable usage of campground data
#### What are your concerns (if any)  Linking the searched location with the weather and campground data at the same time.
#### Deliverables for next checkin: Render the weather card on location search, add suggestions on location search, figure out how to convert XML to json to enable usage of campground data
