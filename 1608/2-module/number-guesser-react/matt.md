# Instructor Evaluation Points: Number Guesser React

# Instructor: Meeka

# Comments:

Bug: When min and max are set to 1 and 10, and the user guesses 3 then I receive an invalid guess message
  - Bug is when min and max are set
  - When hitting the correct number, bug still persists
  - Fixed at time of eval!

Secondary Bug: When min and max are set to 1 and 10, and the user guesses 1 then I receive an invalid guess message.
  - Fixed at time of eval!

Clear button is not disabled if there is nothing to clear
  - Fixed at time of eval!

The reset button should be disabled if there is nothing to reset not present
  - Fixed at time of eval!

Esoteric Bug: If you try really hard you can enter 18+1 and kind of weirdly break things

## Functional Expectations

* 3.5: Application meets all of the functional expectations in Phase Two

Note: bugs/missing features which were fixed at eval.

## Fundamental JavaScript/React Style

* 3.5: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring
