# Instructor Evaluation Points: Number Guesser React
# Instructor: Jhun
# Comments:

- read through the spec a little more
- don't use document.getElementById
- understand the data flow a little more
- fundamental javascript/react style is a little soft because of the mixing of react and vanilla js.
- with that being said I feel confident that you can get it together.
- loved the breaking out of small dumb components
