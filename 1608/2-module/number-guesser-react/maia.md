# Instructor Evaluation Points: Number Guesser React
# Instructor: Meeka
# Comments:

- Bug: 
  - Bug scenario
    - When page is refreshed, and a guess of 4 is entered and guess is selected.
    - Then I see a message: Please enter a number between _ and _
 - Can be fixed by setting a max and min state on component did mount but changes UI interaction for submitting range and shows that default range
 - Could potentially be fixed by changing the messaging if/else statement

- Bug:
  - Reset button only available if guess has been typed in


## Functional Expectations

* 3.5: Application meets all of the functional expectations in Phase Two

## Fundamental JavaScript/React Style

* 3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

Note: Currently at a 2 for not having real components split out - will be bumped to a 3 when a broken out component is demonstrated (will be in budget app)

Note: Bumped to a 3 with [demonstration of broken out component](https://github.com/maiastone/budget-app/blob/ms-refactor-card/components/budgetCard.jsx)
