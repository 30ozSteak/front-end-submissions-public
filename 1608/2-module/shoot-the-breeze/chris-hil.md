# Instructor Evaluation Points: shoot the breeze
# Instructor: yung-jhun
# Comments: great components
- loved the bread crumbs left
- look into making your components more dumb
- great tests. Look into stubbing.

# Specification Adherence


* 3 - The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by React. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.

# Component Architecture

* 4 - Application is broken out into small reusable React components. Complicated functionality is wrapped in parent components. There are zero cases where a complicated component can be broken down into smaller composite components.


# User Interface

* 4 - The application is pleasant, logical, and easy to use. The application is fully responsive, and has clearly had special consideration around usability on devices. There no holes in functionality and the application stands on it own to be used by the instructor without guidance from the developer.


# CSS/Sass Style

* 4: Application has exceptionally well-factored CSS/Sass with little or no duplication and all styles separated out into logical stylesheets. There are zero instances where an instructor would recommend taking a different approach.


# JavaScript Style

* 3- Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.


# Testing

* 4 - Project has a running test suite that exercises the application using Enzyme. The test suite covers almost all aspects of the application (aside from logging in).


# Workflow

* 4 - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.


# Code Sanitation

The output from a code sanitizer (either JSHint or ESLint) shows…

* 4 - Zero complaints


# Design

* 4 - The application is visually appealing and shows thoughtful and effective use of typography, color, and layout. The application looks professional, with visuals enhancing the user’s experience. The evaluator has very few recommended changes.
