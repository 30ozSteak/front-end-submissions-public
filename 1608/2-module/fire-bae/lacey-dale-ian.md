# Comments:

# Specification Adherence

* 4 - Bumped to a 4 with the zero value fix!

# Risk Taking and Creativity

* 4 - Developers pushed themselves and their team by taking risks which is demonstrated by a delivered feature. The application shows evidence that the developers explored concepts and technologies outside the scope of the curriculum.

# Design

* 3.5 - The application has a strong approach to layout and content hierarchy, but typography and color choices are lacking. The evaluator has several recommended changes to improvement.
