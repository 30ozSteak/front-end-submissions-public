# Instructor Evaluation Points: 2DoBox
# Instructor: Taylor Moore

# Specification Adherence

* 4 - The application meets all of the requirements listed above and implements one or more features not included in the specification. The application is an exemplar and is considered a production-level MVP (minimum viable product). The application is ready to be distributed to users.

# Risk Taking and Creativity

* 3.5 - The project shows that the developers carefully considered their approach and were able to implement concepts taught over the last two weeks. The application shows evidence that developers dug deep into documentation for the technologies they used and experimented with different approaches.

# Design

* 3 - The application has a strong approach to layout and content hierarchy, but typography and color choices are lacking. The evaluator has several recommended changes to improvement.

# User Interface

* 3 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality.

# HTML Style


* 4: Developer is able to craft HTML that is semantically correct and clearly organized. There are zero instances where an instructor would recommend taking a different approach. Developer writes markup that is exceptionally clear and well-factored. Application is expertly organized and logically structured with with thoughtful use of tags and selectors.


# CSS/Sass Style

* 4: Application has exceptionally well-factored CSS/Sass with little or no duplication and all styles separated out into logical stylesheets. There are zero instances where an instructor would recommend taking a different approach.

# JavaScript Style

* 3- Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing. Input was broken, major refactoring. With time given and number of developer I think its a three. Developers understand what needed to be done but ran out of time.

# Testing

* 3.5 - Project has a running test suite that tests and multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All functionality is covered by tests. The application has robust unit tests and makes some use of feature testing where appropriate and applicable.

# Workflow

* 2 - The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.

# Accessibility

* 4 - The application demonstrates an exceptional knowledge of web accessibility. The application has no aXe-core violations, is fully functional without using a mouse, and the application uses HTML/CSS to ‘chunk’ content into more manageable pieces. The application utilizes semantic HTML.

# Code Sanitation

The output from a code sanitizer (either JSHint or ESLint) shows…

* 4 - Zero complaints
