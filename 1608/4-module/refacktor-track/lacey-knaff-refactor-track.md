### Discuss: your experience doing daily stand ups
I thought the daily stand ups were great. It's beneficial to hear what every one else is working on and learn from how they structure their days. I also really appreciated that it was so self-directed, it gave me to the time I needed to focus on the job search, which ultimately led to me getting a job.

### Discuss: one negative to this style of project
The whole week, I just felt really overwhelmed. I wasn't sure if I was spending time doing the right things, so I think doing something that was way less structured was great for that moment in time, but I don't know if I could've handled the lack of structure for much longer.

### Talk about something that you didn't know about before this week.
I didn't know how much I needed to prepare/study for a technical interview. It was really good to be able to take the time to go over some concepts that were hazy/I didn't have a great understanding of. I'm not great at coming up with explanations for complex topics without first having studied those topics, so it was super beneficial to be able to create some studying materials.
