# Instructor Feedback

### 3.5:

Student demonstrates excellent attention to detail by tracking all completed work this module in a well formatted markdown document, medium blog post or deployed html page.

The majority of assigned work (including design sessions, etc) is included in the document. All assignments listed are completed or next steps to complete well documented. Student includes strong evidence of work. If an assignment is not completed, student documents reason or an alternate assignment they completed.

**All homework assignments are included in a deployed html page (albeit a poorly styled one) and are fully completed with documentation.** 

Student has completed and can demonstrate 2 to 3 blog posts of high quality (meaning the post has either over 750 coherent words - or - the post is short and targetted, including attributions, diagrams, code, etc to effectively explain a subject)

**Two blog posts were written about web sockets and JWTs. Both are thoughtful, well researched posts in the writer's own words. Can relate to the incredible joy of real-time sport scores.**

Student has completed some work above and beyond the expectations of the module, including but not limited to running a repeating student lead session, putting together a conference talk proposal and either submitting it or working with a non-student on said proposal, significant open source contribution, speaking at a meetup, etc.

**No evidence of above actions.**
