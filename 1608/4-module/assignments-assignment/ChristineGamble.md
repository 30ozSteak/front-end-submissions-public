### 3:

Student demonstrates excellent attention to detail by tracking all completed work this module in a well formatted markdown document, medium blog post or deployed html page. Student may have had to be reminded about what ‘well formatted markdown’ means.

Around 75% of assigned work (including design sessions, etc) is included in the document. It is not clear in the document what state of completion the work is in. Student shows a reasonable effort to complete assignments.

Student has completed and can demonstrate 1 blog posts of high quality (meaning the post has either over 750 coherent words - or - the post is short and targetted, including attributions, diagrams, code, etc to effectively explain a subject)
