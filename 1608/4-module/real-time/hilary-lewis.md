## Completion

* I have all functionality working except an image linking to each vote.

# Code Quality

#### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you are proud of
[Link to code](https://github.com/hilarylewis92/polling-app/blob/master/server.js#L80-L99)

* Why were you proud of this piece of code?
I am proud of this code because I took the time to read the docs and figure out how to grab information from the object and display it on the screen.

#### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you feel not great about
[Link to code](https://github.com/hilarylewis92/polling-app/blob/master/server.js#L80-L99)

* Why do you feel not awesome about the code? What challenges did you face trying to write/refactor it?
As you can see, this is the same code I am proud of because I tried really hard to implement the image of each voted within this code but I failed because of the deadline. I also think I can refactor this function to be more simple but I did not have time do do that. 

#### Attach a screenshot or paste the output from your terminal of the result of your test-suite running.
