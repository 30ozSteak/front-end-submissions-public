# Code Quality

#### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you are proud of
[Code I can pat on the back](https://github.com/rcwestlake/pollr/blob/master/public/js/poll.js#L107-L113)

* Why were you proud of this piece of code?

Very clean, also uses the data to easily identify which choice is made later.

#### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you feel not great about
[Code I would say 'better luck next time kid' to](https://github.com/rcwestlake/pollr/blob/master/public/js/poll.js#L67-L92)

* Why do you feel not awesome about the code? What challenges did you face trying to write/refactor it?

While it is simply chaining 3 promises together, it seems there could be a better, more efficient way.
