##Completion

###Were you able to complete the base functionality?

Yes.

###Which extensions, if any, did you complete?

None.

##Code Quality

###Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you are proud of

[Excerpt that I am proud of](https://github.com/gness1804/real-time/blob/master/test/feature-tests.js#L8-L38)

###Why were you proud of this piece of code?

I wrote this code to mock a login to my application and to provide fake user data. I am particularly proud of lines 30-32, as this represents my successful efforts to stub a user login, which is a challenge that proved particularly difficult. I am also proud of the fact that I broke this code out into separate functions rather than keeping it in the tests themselves.

###Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you feel not great about

[Excerpt that could use more work](https://github.com/gness1804/real-time/blob/master/public/core-functionality.js#L64-L79)

###Why do you feel not awesome about the code? What challenges did you face trying to write/refactor it?

This function is longer than it needs to be. As one can see, it contains three loops, two of which loop through the same array. The main challenges in writing and refactoring were trying to tally all the votes in a way that kept the lines of code to a minimum. Tallying the votes was more difficult than I'd thought, especially since there was no static 'A, B, C, D' choices. I know this code needs refactoring, but I ran out of time in the end.

##Attach a screenshot or paste the output from your terminal of the result of your test-suite running.

[Test suite](https://github.com/gness1804/real-time/blob/master/public/real-time-passing-tests.png)

##Provide a link to an example, if you have one, of a test that covers an 'edge case' or 'unhappy path'

[Edge case test](https://github.com/gness1804/real-time/blob/master/test/feature-tests.js#L85-L105)

This tests my data validation that gives the user an error message if they leave one or more input fields blank when entering a question.

##Please feel free to ask any other questions or make any other statements below!

This project was hard, but I am proud of my work and my final project.
