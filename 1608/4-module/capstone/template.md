## Goals

By the end of this session we will have established Capstone projects that'll guide your last three weeks in the program. It's your final project which means it's your last opportunity to build something your really proud of and can show off for your portfolio. It's also the last time you will get to work with your cohort-mates and master your workflow before becoming a professional developer. Take risks, be creative, work nicely with your team and build something useful for others.

The project is due on March 1st.

### Part 1: Solo

Take the first 15 minutes to summarize and post your ideas. For *each one* create
an issue on the [Turing Mastery Project repo](https://github.com/turingschool/mastery_project) and, in the description, summarize the idea in the following format:

* Name:
* Problem it solves:
* How it solves it:
* Technical challenges:

If your a proposal similar to yours is already in the list of issues, please add to that issue with your refinements. We'll rename the issue to the name you choose, but this will help us limit the number of duplicate ideas.

### Part 2: Small Groups

Then get together in assigned groups of three to:

* Review/discuss each of your ideas
* Refine them
* Add comments to the issue
* Select your two favorites (from the entire group, they could be from the same person)

### Part 3: Pitch & Merge

Then we'll get back together and each group of three will come up to pitch their two ideas. Spend less than two minutes on each pitch.

After pitches, we'll merge any ideas that are very similar.

### Part 4: Voting

Then we'll plot the pitched ideas on the board. Each of you should then pass through and mark the **three** ideas **you most want to exist**.

After all votes are cast, the top three vote getters are selected. If there are any ties, Alex will cast the deciding votes.

### Part 5: Teaming

We will team up by interest in projects. Teams can be between 2 - 4 people. If no consensus is made on teams, they will be randomly picked.

### Part 6: Wireframing & Design

With the project and team established, get together with your group to wireframe
the key screens / interactions and figure out how you'll implement services.

Below are the key concepts from our instructional sessions which may inform some
of your thinking:

- Building applications for the web, desktop, and mobile platforms
- Offline applications and progressive web applications
- Building real-time web applications with WebSockets
- Building servers to store and share data between users

### Part 7: Workflow

Pick a team lead to create a repository for each the selected projects. If you have a clever name, now is the time.

## Rubric

### Production (75 points)

- 75: Application is deployed and in production.
- 0: Application is not deployed and in production.

### JavaScript Style (50 points)

* 50: Application has exceptionally well-factored code with little or no duplication and all components separated out into logical components. There _zero_ instances where an instructor would recommend taking a different approach.
* 35: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.
* 15: Application has some duplication and minor bugs. Developer can speak to most choices made in the code and knows what every line is doing.
* 10: Application has a significant amount of duplication and one or more major bugs. Developer cannot speak to most choices and does not know what every line of code is doing.
* 5: Developer writes code with unnecessary variables, operations, or steps which do not increase clarity.
* 0: There is little or no client-side code. Developer writes code that is difficult to understand. Application logic shows poor decomposition with too much logic mashed together.

### User Interface (40 points)

* 40: The application is pleasant, logical, and easy to use. There no holes in functionality and the application stands on it own to be used by the instructor _without_ guidance from the developer.
* 30: The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality.
* 20: The application shows effort in the interface, but the result is not effective. The evaluator has some difficulty using the application when reviewing the features in the user stories.
* 0: The application is confusing or difficult to use.

### Risk Taking and Creativity (60 points)

Instructor/developers will select one feature in the project to review for this section of the rubric.

- 60: Developers pushed themselves and their team by taking risks which is demonstrated by a delivered feature. Developers explored concepts and technologies outside the scope of the curriculum.
- 50: Developers pushed themselves and their team by taking risks which is demonstrated by an almost delivered feature. Developers explored concepts and technologies outside the scope of the curriculum.
- 30: Developers attempted to implement feature using technologies not covered in class but it did not result in a delivered feature.
- 10: Developers did not build any features.

### Testing (50 Points)

* 50: Project has a running test suite that exercises the application at multiple levels (feature and unit). The test suite covers almost all aspects of the application.
* 40: Project has a running test suite that tests and multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All functionality is covered by tests. The application makes some use of feature testing.
* 30: Project has sporadic use of tests and multiple levels. The application contains numerous holes in testing and/or many features are untested.
* 20: Testing in the application is sporadic and does not add confidence that the application would note break during refactoring.
* 0: There is little or no evidence of testing in this application.

### Workflow (50 Points)

* 50: The developers effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There is visible evidence of code review happening in pull requests and discussion around approaches.
* 35: The developers makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base. There is little evidence of code review.
* 15: The developers make large commits covering multiple features that make it difficult for the evaluator to determine the evolution of the application. There are formatting issues in the code base. (This is important. These issues should not be able to make it past code review.)
* 5: The developers committed the code to version control in only a few commits. The evaluator cannot determine the evolution of the application.
* 0: The application was not checked into version control.

#### Extensions (20 points each)

- Developer contributes to or creates an npm module/library.
