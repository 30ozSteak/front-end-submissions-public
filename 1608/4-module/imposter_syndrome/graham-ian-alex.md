## Completion

#### Were you able to complete the base functionality of your planned MVP?
Yes

#### Did you take risks and creatively utilized Electron's many different abilities?

* What is one feature that you think is really creative?
  * We were able to chart our session times using Chart.js
  * We also really like our fire icon!

#### Which extensions, if any, did you complete?

None.

# Code Quality

#### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you are proud of
[Chart code](https://github.com/gness1804/fired-up/blob/master/lib/render.js#L239-L259)
* Why were you proud of this piece of code?

This code succeeds in implementing a difficult functionality: charting session data. It functions with a variable number of sessions and session data, so it is flexible and efficient.

#### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you feel not great about
[Code from render](https://github.com/gness1804/fired-up/blob/master/lib/render.js#L1-L25)
* Why do you feel not awesome about the code? What challenges did you face trying to write/refactor it?

This beginning part of the render file has a ton of global variables. It also illustrates that much of the code on this page could have been broken into separate files.
