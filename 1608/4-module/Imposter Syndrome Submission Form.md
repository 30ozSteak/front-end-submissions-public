## Completion

#### Were you able to complete the base functionality of your planned MVP?
	Yes.

		The crossfader. 

#### Which extensions, if any, did you complete?

##Code Quality

#### [We like this action.](https://github.com/MilkMan90/ck5/blob/master/app/actions/loadsong.js#L56-L85)
* Why were you proud of this piece of code?

	Because aSync, promises, Promise.all, and we refactored this from within a 	component and put it into this beautiful action. 

#### [This component renders too much too often.](https://github.com/MilkMan90/ck5/blob/master/app/components/PlayBox.js#L80-L103)
* Why do you feel not awesome about the code? What challenges did you face trying to write/refactor it? 

	How we re-render the entire Playbox component on each second "tick" of the 	song, so that we can keep the progressbar and time updated. Given a bit more 	time, we could have broken this out into smaller components that managed 	themselves
