### Evaluator: YUNG-Jhun
### Student: chris, ryan, dale
### Notes:

- be comfortable breaking logic into other classes or functions
- keep writing tests.
- group feels comfortable looping through things. Would love to see them move into using more map functions
- Saw really great instances of good practices. Would love to see more SRP functions


# Functional Expectations

3 - Application is fully playable without crashes or bugs

# User Interface

4 - The application is pleasant, logical, and easy to use. There no holes in functionality and the application stands on it own to be used by the instructor without guidance from the developer.

# Testing

4 - Project has a running test suite that exercises the application at multiple levels. The test suite covers almost all aspects of the application and uses mocks and stubs when appropriate.


# JavaScript Style

3 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

# Workflow

4 - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

# Code Sanitation

3 - Five or fewer complaints
