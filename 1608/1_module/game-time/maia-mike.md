## Rubric
### Evaluator: Taylor Moore
### Student: Maia & Mike
### Notes: Scores are based off the continued work on this project. Maia and Mike are meeting Taylor to review the work over the break on Wednesday, 12pm. Super impressed with the group for taking on the challenge to create a quad linked-list. Things to look for on Wednesday - Testing, more instructions, 'you lose screen', more organization. Nice job!

# Functional Expectations

3 - Application is fully playable without crashes or bugs

# User Interface

3 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality.

# Testing

3 - Project has a running test suite that tests and multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All functionality is covered by tests. The application makes some use of integration testing.

# JavaScript Style


3 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.


# Workflow

4 - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

# Code Sanitation

The output from JSHint showsâ€¦

4 - Zero complaints
