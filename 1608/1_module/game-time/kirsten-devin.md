# Functional Expectations

3 - Application is fully playable without crashes or bugs

# User Interface

3.5 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality.

# Testing

3 - Project has a running test suite that tests and multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All functionality is covered by tests. The application makes some use of integration testing.


# JavaScript Style

3 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

# Workflow

4 - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

# Code Sanitation

The output from JSHint showsâ€¦

4 - Zero complaints
