#### Evaluator(s): Brenna
#### Evaluation Notes(optional):
  Super clear that both parties touched all parts of the code. Design decisions were all very intentional and devs can speak to why they chose to make css decisions they did. 

***

### Functional Expectations

- 4: Application meets all of the functional expectations in Phase Three.

### HTML Style

- 3:  Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing.

### CSS Style

- 4: Application has exceptionally well-factored CSS with little or no duplication and all styles separated out into logical stylesheets. There are zero instances where an instructor would recommend taking a different approach.

### Fundamental JavaScript Style

- 3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring.

### Workflow

- 4: The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.
