### Functional Expectations

- 4: Application meets all of the functional expectations in Phase Three.

### HTML Style

- 3.5:  Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing.

### CSS Style

- 4: Application has exceptionally well-factored CSS with little or no duplication and all styles separated out into logical stylesheets. There are zero instances where an instructor would recommend taking a different approach.

### Fundamental JavaScript Style

- 3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring.

### Workflow

- 3: The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.
