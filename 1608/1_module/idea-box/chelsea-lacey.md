# Instructor Evaluation Points: IdeaBox

## Specification Adherence

3 - The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by jQuery. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.

Very well done, good work!

## User Interface

3.5 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality.

Note: really good job, a couple small details in the comp were overlooked.

## JavaScript Style

2.75 really good job, in a very good place to start refactoring. Needs a little tidying up, but generally well done.

<!-- 3- Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.
