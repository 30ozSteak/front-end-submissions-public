## Specification Adherence
3 - The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by jQuery. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.


## User Interface
4 - The application is pleasant, logical, and easy to use. There no holes in functionality and the application stands on it own to be used by the instructor without guidance from the developer.

## JavaScript Style
2 - Your application has some duplication and minor bugs. Developer can speak to most choices made in the code and knows what every line is doing.


## Workflow
4 - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.
