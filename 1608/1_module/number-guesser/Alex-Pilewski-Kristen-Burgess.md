# Functional Expectations

4: Application meets all of the functional expectations in Phase Three


# Fundamental JavaScript Style

notes: Strong effort towards writing good javascript. Some opportunities to refactor and reuse code. Would be beneficial for devs to go back and refactor with a mentor.
