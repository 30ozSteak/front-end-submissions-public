## Rubric
### Evaluator: Louisa
### Student: Kristen Burgess
### Notes:
Kristen is not afraid to try things out and experiment, but needs to work on fully and deeply understanding exactly what the code she is writing is doing and why it’s doing what it is. She knows how to get things to work, but when pressed can’t always explain what is going on under the hood. She absorbs information, direction, and explanations very well, is an absolute pleasure to work with, and I expect that she will quickly improve on deeper understanding. Good job!
