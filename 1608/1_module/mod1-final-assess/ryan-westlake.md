## Rubric
### Evaluator: Louisa
### Student: Ryan Westlake
### Notes:
Solid understanding of Javascript, a pleasure to pair with. Picks up on very slight suggestions and runs with it, takes direction and collaborates very well, and understands what each line of his code is doing. He is harder on himself than he needs to be, and I encouraged him to be kind to himself. Well done!
