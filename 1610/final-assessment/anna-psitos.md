### Evaluator: Bree
Anna has progressed quite a bit in her grasp of javascript. I would like to see improvement in ability to break out code into logical components more quickly. Not just from a function perspective, but specifically faster on leveraging variables correctly and as a helpful piece to break the problem into steps.

Use of pseudo code is good, but could use some improvement in breaking down into even smaller steps.

Anna will retake the assessment.
