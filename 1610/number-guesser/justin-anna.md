### Comment:
They got off to a rocky start on the first day of the project and didn't balance the work/effort equally or fairly. They regrouped and recovered very strongly, and both made a big effort to work together and learn from the project and pairing experience. Could have a been a discouraging project, but they turned it around and ended very positively. Great job!
