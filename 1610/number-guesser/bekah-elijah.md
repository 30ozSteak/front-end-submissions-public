### Specification Adherence

### UX/UI Expectations
* 3: Application shows strong effort towards matching the comp, but some details have been missed. Any extensions are simple, clean design, content organization, and well thought out experience and user interactions.

### Functional Expectations
	3.25 - had this for phase 3: Add additional inputs that allows the user to specify what the minimum and maximum numbers should be.
<!--
* 3: Application meets all of the functional expectations in Phase Two -->

### Fundamental JavaScript Style
* 3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

### Comments:
they did a really good job, they went and totally refactored it after they built it the first time. JS was clean, reusable, both could speak to all of it. well done.
