### Reviewer: Bree

### Functional Expectations
2: Application meets all of the functional expectations in Phase One.

### Fundamental JavaScript Style
2.5: Application runs but the code has long functions, unnecessary or poorly named variables, and needs significant refactoring.

### Workflow
2.8: The developer makes large commits covering multiple features that make it difficult for the evaluator to determine the evolution of the application.

### HTML Style
3: Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing.

### CSS Style
2: Your application has some duplication and minor bugs. Developer can speak to most choices made in the code and knows what every line is doing.
