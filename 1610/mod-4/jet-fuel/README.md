[](https://github.com/jksmall0631/jet-fuel/blob/master/server.js#L121-L132)

* Why were you proud of this piece of code?

Proud because it was a much larger block of code and got refactored to look much better.

#### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you feel not great about
[](https://github.com/jksmall0631/jet-fuel/blob/master/public/app.js#L74-L85)


* Why do you feel not awesome about the code? What challenges did you face trying to write/refactor it?

Not happy with this because we didn't have time to break it out and refactor.

#### Attach a screenshot or paste the output from your terminal of the result of your test-suite running.
We ran out of time with unit testing, and had a hard time understanding what we could test. We also had all server tests passing and realized last minute that we needed to create a testing db. Started going through the blog that was linked in the lesson but ran out of time to implement the whole thing.

Meeka - Remember last mod when I was having CORS issues with my assessment? It came back to haunt me this project too! For a good portion of the project I wasn't able to push up code because I was getting issues with the database. Is there anything I can do to fix it??

# Instructor Feedback

We both struggled with the unit testing, especially setting it up. It'd be really helpful to get a refresher on that during the unit testing lesson!
