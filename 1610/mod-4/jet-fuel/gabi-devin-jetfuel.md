# Code Quality

#### Specific block of your code on Github that you are proud of

[Proud Code](https://github.com/gprocell927/jetFuel/blob/master/public/index.js#L55-L67)

We are proud of this piece of code because it delt with a weird issue with trailing commas between all our folders and links. We figured out the reason the commas existed was because the way we were appending to the page was mapping over the array and returning a single string. We figured out that using a reduce instead got rid of the commas.

#### Specific block of your code on Github that you are not proud of

[Not Proud Code](https://github.com/gprocell927/jetFuel/blob/master/server.js#L79-L89)

We don't feel awesome about this code because it is WIP. We worked for a long time and learned a lot about databases and interactions, but we weren't able to figure out the relations between our client side and database to implement the counter.

#### Notes
This project was fun, terrible and magical. Why is it called JetFuel? We had fun working through problems... getting to build a database was cool, we feel smarter... but confused. It was hard. We want to finish the counter to feel good about ourselves. I think there's still a lot of confusion about how to form relationships between the client side and the server side/database.
