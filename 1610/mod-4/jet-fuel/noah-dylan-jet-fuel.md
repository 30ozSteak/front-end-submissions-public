[Link to code block in repo](https://github.com/noahpeden/jet-fuel/blob/master/server.js)

* Why were you proud of this piece of code?

Cause it's our first truly backend server side code.
And also because we learned and used Knex syntax.

* Why do you feel not awesome about the code? What challenges did you face trying to write/refactor it?

Still need to refactor into smaller functions such as moving axios to be a dynamic call.

#### Provide a link to an example, if you have one, of a test that covers an 'edge case' or 'unhappy path'
None, we had a lot of trouble trying to set up our unit tests as we couldn't figure out how to get past the jquery not defined error that we were getting.

# Instructor Feedback

## Instructor Evaluation Points

The following set of points are distributed at the discretion of the instructor.

### Specification Adherence

* **40 points**: All functionality was met except for displaying the date created and number of clicks for each URL.

### User Interface

* **12 points** - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality.

Overall, the application is well structured with the following exceptions:

* Don't display the sorting buttons until a folder is clicked. A user will be confused to see those buttons without any information to sort.
* Label the 'SORT' button with 'SORT by popularity'. The generic 'SORT' label doesn't give the user any idea what it's going to be sorted by.
* The list of URLS is not formatted well. It's a list with commas seperating them and the URL's only show an integer without the number of clicks and created date.

### Data Persistence with SQL Database

* **20 points** - The application persists data in a SQL database but with correct relationships between folders and URLs.

### Testing

* **7 points** - Project has sporadic use of tests and multiple levels. Not all controller actions are tested. There are little or no attempts at integration testing.

There are 3 passing server-side tests and 1 failing test. There is an attempt at unit testing but no passing unit tests. 

### JavaScript Style

* **15 points** - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

The code is well broken out into small functions and consistent style, but there are areas of improvement:

* I would have liked to seen the code written in ES6
* Remove any unused global variables (var $shortUrl = $('.short-url'))

### Workflow

* **20 points** - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

Lots of small, atomic commits and good conversations in PRs.

## To get a 3 on this project, you need to score 110 points or higher

## To get a 4 on this project, you need to score 135 points or higher

# Final Score: 114 / 150
