# Instructor Feedback

## Instructor Evaluation Points

The following set of points are distributed at the discretion of the instructor.

### Specification Adherence

* **50 points**: No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.

All project requirements were met.

### User Interface

* **20 points** - The application is pleasant, logical, and easy to use. There no holes in functionality and the application stands on it own to be used by the instructor _without_ guidance from the developer.

Really good UI. Simple, clean, really well done. 

### Data Persistence with SQL Database

* **20 points** - The application persists data in a SQL database but with correct relationships between folders and URLs.

### Testing

* **18 points** - Project has a running test suite that exercises the application at multiple levels including server and client tests.

Every endpoint was tested and lots of unit tests for folders and urls. Only thing I would have liked would be to have completed the skipped tests, but otherwise awesome job getting that many tests written.

### JavaScript Style

* **15 points** - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

Really liked how you used Folder and Url prototypes to handle click events. Some of your event handler functions are pretty long and could have been broken into even smaller functions.  I would have pulled out the convertTimestamps function into a helper file and imported it into server.js. I also would have liked to seen more consistency between ES6 and ES5 (you mixed () => {} with function() {}).

### Workflow

* **20 points** - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

Lots of small commits with good descriptions and good conversation in PR's about what the PR does.
