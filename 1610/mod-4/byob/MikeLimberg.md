# Code Quality

#### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you are proud of
[Link to code block in repo](https://github.com/mlimberg/BYOBackend/blob/master/server.js#L103-L114)

* Why were you proud of this piece of code?

Most of the code in all of the end points is so similar, but with this endpoint specifically it was great to see how the
server can do some of the heavy lifting and return customized data. 

#### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you feel not great about
[Link to code block in repo](https://github.com/mlimberg/BYOBackend/blob/master/server.js#L27-L39)

* Why do you feel not awesome about the code? What challenges did you face trying to write/refactor it?

Seems like I don't fully understand when catch will in fact work, also don't like the repetitive code. Tried incorporating
the `catch` outside of the if statement but ran into errors.

#### Attach a screenshot or paste the output from your terminal of the result of your test-suite running.
