# Code Quality

#### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you are proud of
[code](https://github.com/pescel/wtd-api/blob/master/server.js#L77-L90)

* Why were you proud of this piece of code?
I've never made a custom endpoint, so this part of the code was a challenge for me. 

#### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you feel not great about
[code](https://github.com/pescel/wtd-api/blob/master/tests/server_test.js#L114-L125)

* Why do you feel not awesome about the code? What challenges did you face trying to write/refactor it?
Some of my tests are too generic and don't test anything specific enough. I struggled through a few tests that get more specific, 
but I just ran out of time to figure it out for all of them. 

#### Attach a screenshot or paste the output from your terminal of the result of your test-suite running.

#### Provide a link to an example, if you have one, of a test that covers an 'edge case' or 'unhappy path'

#### Please feel free to ask any other questions or make any other statements below!
had a hard time with testing this time around. I had a lot of problems with tests because my db wasn't being cleared out. Is there something
I can do to get that to clear on it's own or should I have installed something?
