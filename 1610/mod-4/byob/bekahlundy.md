[this get request](https://github.com/bekahlundy/dog-api-extension/blob/master/server.js#L28)

* Why were you proud of this piece of code?
I spent a long time going over this with meeka, and I am happy with how it turned out. It was difficult to figure out at first but i feel more comfortable with it now

[this get request](https://github.com/bekahlundy/dog-api-extension/blob/master/server.js#L110)

* Why do you feel not awesome about the code? What challenges did you face trying to write/refactor it?

I am not sure about this get request. I think I should have had another get request like the one above, where i can get every photo associated with one feeling, instead of just one photo

#### Attach a screenshot or paste the output from your terminal of the result of your test-suite running.
