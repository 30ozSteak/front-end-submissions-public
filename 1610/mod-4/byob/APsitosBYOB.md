# Code Quality

#### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you are proud of

I really like my delete functions. [Link](https://github.com/apsitos/HappyHourAPI/blob/master/server.js#L84) to the first line of the delete function in my restuarant describe block.

* Why were you proud of this piece of code?
Figuring out how to properly go through each table and reset the foreign keys was a fun challenge. 


#### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you feel not great about


* Why do you feel not awesome about the code? What challenges did you face trying to write/refactor it?



#### Attach a screenshot or paste the output from your terminal of the result of your test-suite running.

#### Provide a link to an example, if you have one, of a test that covers an 'edge case' or 'unhappy path'

#### Please feel free to ask any other questions or make any other statements below!

Four tests are currently skipped. Two have errors relating to foreign-key constraints, and two have syntax errors that do not catch when testing the happy paths, only when testing the unhappy. I've rewritten the code both in the server file and in the test file multiple times and can't find the error. At 11pm on Saturday, I decided enough was enough.
