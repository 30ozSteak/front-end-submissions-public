## Rubric

### Blog Post (45 Points - 15 points per post)

### JavaScript Style (40 points)

* 40: Application has exceptionally well-factored code with little or no duplication and all components separated out into logical components. There _zero_ instances where an instructor would recommend taking a different approach.
* 35: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.
* 15: Application has some duplication and minor bugs. Developer can speak to most choices made in the code and knows what every line is doing.
* 10: Application has a significant amount of duplication and one or more major bugs. Developer cannot speak to most choices and does not know what every line of code is doing.
* 5: Developer writes code with unnecessary variables, operations, or steps which do not increase clarity.
* 0: There is little or no client-side code. Developer writes code that is difficult to understand. Application logic shows poor decomposition with too much logic mashed together.

### User Interface (10 points)

* 10: The application is pleasant, logical, and easy to use. There no holes in functionality and the application stands on it own to be used by the instructor _without_ guidance from the developer.
* 7: The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality.
* 2: The application shows effort in the interface, but the result is not effective. The evaluator has some difficulty using the application when reviewing the features in the user stories.
* 0: The application is confusing or difficult to use.

### Risk Taking and Creativity (60 points)

Instructor/developers will select one feature in the project to review for this section of the rubric.

- 60: Developers pushed themselves and their team by taking risks which is demonstrated by a delivered feature. Developers explored concepts and technologies outside the scope of the curriculum.
- 50: Developers pushed themselves and their team by taking risks which is demonstrated by an almost delivered feature. Developers explored concepts and technologies outside the scope of the curriculum.
- 30: Developers attempted to implement feature using technologies not covered in class but it did not result in a delivered feature.
- 10: Developers did not build any features.

### Workflow (20 Points)

* 20: The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There is visible evidence of code review happening in pull requests and discussion around approaches. Your team uses Waffle effectively to create small, single functionality user stories that are assigned to team members.
* 15: The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base. There is little evidence of code review. Your team uses Waffle but user stories are large, broad features.
* 5: The developer makes large commits covering multiple features that make it difficult for the evaluator to determine the evolution of the application. There are formatting issues in the code base. (This is important. These issues should not be able to make it past code review.)
* 1: The developer committed the code to version control in only a few commits. The evaluator cannot determine the evolution of the application.
* 0: The application was not checked into version control.

#### Extensions (20 points each)

- Developer contributes to or creates an npm module/library.
- Developer packaged their application for distribution aka you can send me a zip folder with your app and I can use it on my computer.
