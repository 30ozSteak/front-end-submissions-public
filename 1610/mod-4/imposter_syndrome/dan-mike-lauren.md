## Rubric

### Blog Post (45 Points - 15 points per post)

### JavaScript Style (40 points)

* 35: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

### User Interface (10 points)

* 7: The application is pleasant, logical, and easy to use. There no holes in functionality and the application stands on it own to be used by the instructor _without_ guidance from the developer.

Can't select color in top left where the color zone is.

### Risk Taking and Creativity (60 points)

Instructor/developers will select one feature in the project to review for this section of the rubric.

- 40: Developers pushed themselves and their team by taking risks which is demonstrated by an almost delivered feature. Developers explored concepts and technologies outside the scope of the curriculum.

### Workflow (20 Points)

* 18: The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There is visible evidence of code review happening in pull requests and discussion around approaches. Your team uses Waffle effectively to create small, single functionality user stories that are assigned to team members.

Better commit titles, more consistent use of Waffle
