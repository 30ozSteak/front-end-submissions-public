## Rubric

### Blog Post (45 Points - 15 points per post)

### JavaScript Style (40 points)

* 35: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

### User Interface (10 points)

* 7: The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality.

Would have liked a better UI pattern for going back to main screen instead of the dialog box.

### Risk Taking and Creativity (60 points)

Instructor/developers will select one feature in the project to review for this section of the rubric.

- 50: Developers pushed themselves and their team by taking risks which is demonstrated by an almost delivered feature. Developers explored concepts and technologies outside the scope of the curriculum.

Wished there was more Marko to look at to see it's pros vs. cons. Awesome job communicating with Marko team to figure out bugs.

### Workflow (20 Points)

* 18: The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There is visible evidence of code review happening in pull requests and discussion around approaches. Your team uses Waffle effectively to create small, single functionality user stories that are assigned to team members.

More detailed conversations in PRs, assign users in Waffle.

#### Extensions (20 points each)

- Developer contributes to or creates an npm module/library.
- Developer packaged their application for distribution aka you can send me a zip folder with your app and I can use it on my computer.
