# Code Quality

* I guess I'm most proud of actually taking the time to refactor my code. I did 3 sessions of refactoring and tried to break things up as much as possible. Also I feel this is the best I have organized my code. I'm actually equally proud of my tests. I finally got to spend a chunk of time testing.


#### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you feel not great about
[Link to code block in repo]https://github.com/jwood11atx/Jet-Fuel/blob/master/app/index.html)

* I didn't spend much time with the html code. I kinda just built it out without really thinking about it too much. I just knew what kind of sections and containers I needed and never revisited it to clean up.

#### Attach a screenshot or paste the output from your terminal of the result of your test-suite running.

Anything else you wanna say!

* Really enjoyed the project! Looking forward to learn more backend and also I have a commented out test I'd like to get help with. It's a PATCH request that would never actually change the data in the test database.
