## Instructor Evaluation Points
### Evaluator: Robbie

### Notes

* JavaScript looked pretty good, but there were some large functions that needed breaking down and refactoring, for sets of variables that are needed within a function, could break these out into a function that returns an object with these variables
* git workflow was good, but there were some large commits and needed more conversation in the PRs
* Alignment and width of buttons/input fields was getting off compared to the comp especially when the window size was wide
