## Instructor Evaluation Points
### Evaluator: Robbie

### Notes

* Should be using IDs in HTML for unique elements and sharing classes for CSS styling, HTML was otherwise clean
* CSS needed some refactoring since there was some repetition
* JavaScript was good, but could use some refactoring into smaller functions
* The searching and tag filtering had some unexpected user interaction where tags were selected, but if a search term was added then all of the results would appear regardless of what tags were selected
* Using localStorage to search through ideas and hide them; this can be done through the DOM so as not to go through localStorage and risk changing user's data
* Could use more conversation in PRs, but git/GitHub workflow looked good otherwise
