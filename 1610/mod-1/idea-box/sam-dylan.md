## Instructor Evaluation Points
### Evaluator: Robbie

### Notes

* No extensions, but base functionality was all there
* JavaScript needs some refactoring into smaller functions, there were some large if/else statements that were getting difficult to follow
* Could use some more conversation in PRs, but commits were atomic and looked good
* HTML was very clean, but CSS needed some details worked out in order to match the comp, width of buttons and alignment of the input fields was a little off, especially as you expand - could use a max width media query to limit the width of the app

### Specification Adherence

- 3 - The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by jQuery. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.

### HTML Style

- 4: Developer is able to craft HTML that is semantically correct and clearly organized. There are zero instances where an instructor would recommend taking a different approach. Developer writes markup that is exceptionally clear and well-factored. Application is expertly organized and logically structured with with a clear, thoughtful use of tags and selectors.

### CSS Style

- 3: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS is doing.

### JavaScript Style

- 3- Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

### Workflow

- 4 - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

### Collaboration

- 3 - Team members employ PRs and issues to both manage their work and communication/collaboration around executing the tasks.
