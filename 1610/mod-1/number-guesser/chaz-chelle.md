### Reviewer: Bree

### UX/UI Expectations
- 3: Application shows strong effort towards matching the comp, but some details have been missed. Any extensions are simple, clean design, content organization, and well thought out experience and user interactions.

### Functional Expectations
- 2: Application meets all of the functional expectations in Phase One

### Fundamental JavaScript Style
- 2.5 Application runs but the code has long functions, unnecessary or poorly named variables, and needs significant refactoring
