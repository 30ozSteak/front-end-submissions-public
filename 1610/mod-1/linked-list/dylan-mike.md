## Notes

* Event bubbling selections should be more specific instead of querying on the document, something like querying a smaller container
* A couple of long JavaScript functions that could use some refactoring and breaking down into smaller functions
* Workflow was good, but needed more conversation in the pull requests
* HTML and CSS was good, need to use unique IDs more for JavaScript hooks, and then reuse classes for similar CSS styles
