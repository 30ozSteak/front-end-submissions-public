## Notes

* JavaScript needed refactoring, a bunch of long functions that needed to be broken down
* JavaScript was pretty DRY overall, but needed refactoring
* The event bubbling selections were too vague (using document instead of a specific container)
* Workflow was good technically, but there needed to be more conversation in pull requests
* Left in some dummy links in the HTML...shouldn't be there
* CSS was not DRY and could use some refactoring, but the styles matched the comp well

## Rubric

### Functional Expectations

- 4: Application meets all of the functional expectations in Phase Three.

### Fundamental JavaScript Style

- 3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring.
- **2.5**
- 2: Application runs but the code has long functions, unnecessary or poorly named variables, and needs significant refactoring.

### Workflow

- 3: The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.

### HTML Style

- 3:  Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing.

### CSS Style

- 3:  Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS is doing.
