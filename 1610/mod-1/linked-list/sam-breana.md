## Notes

* Workflow was lopsided, wanted to see less functionality completed in exchange for more pairing and sharing who is driving
* Merging your own pull requests is bad...
* Mixing vanilla JavaScript and jQuery selectors in the same file - be consistent
* HTML was getting hard to read - don't be afraid to add a little whitespace to break up container elements and make HTML more readable
* Should use IDs for unique elements, especially for JavaScript hooks, and then share class names for the same styling
