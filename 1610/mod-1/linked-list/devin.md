## Notes

* Would have been nice to have some visual affordance for disabled buttons other than no hover (hover does not work on mobile)
* JavaScript was really DRY and very well refactored - was worried about using global vars, but OK in some cases to not repeat query selections
* Workflow was fine, only working as a team of one...so couldn't score higher than a 3 - needed some smaller feature branches instead of the whole phases
* HTML and CSS was clean, but wanted to see better use of unique IDs for JS and reuse of classes for CSS styling

## Rubric

### Functional Expectations

- 4: Application meets all of the functional expectations in Phase Three.

### Fundamental JavaScript Style

- 4: Application demonstrates excellent knowledge of JavaScript syntax, style, and refactoring.

### Workflow

- 3: The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.

### HTML Style

- 3:  Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing.

### CSS Style

- 4: Application has exceptionally well-factored CSS with little or no duplication and all styles separated out into logical stylesheets. There are zero instances where an instructor would recommend taking a different approach.
