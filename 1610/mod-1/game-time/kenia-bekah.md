### Functional Expectations

* 4 - Application is fully playable and exceeds the expectations set by instructors

### User Interface

missing directives on how to play (i.e. am i using my mouse? the arrow keys?)

* 3 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality.

### Testing

No functionality is tested, presence of functions is covered. needed a refactor of the codebase to make testing more straightforward. got stuck with dealing with canvas + tests.

* 2 - Project has sporadic use of tests at multiple levels. The application contains numerous holes in testing and/or many features are untested.

### JavaScript Style

soft 3, significant amount of working code is in the index.js file. needs to be refactored.

* 3 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

### Workflow

* 4 - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

### Code Sanitation

The output from JSHint showsâ€¦
