## Final Assessment: Justin Wood

### Evaluator: Robbie

### Notes
* Solid JS and jQuery, needed some refactoring (into functions and consolidating up jQuery selections) but not enough time in the end
* Completed phase 1 and phase 2
* No issues in workflow, very proficient with Atom
* Collaboration was definitely improved from mock assessment, wanted to hear more about "why" you are writing the code and not so much as to "what" code you are writing
