## Final Assessment: Eric Sayler

### Evaluator: Robbie

### Notes
* Everything was there conceptually, but was rusty from working on game time during the past two weeks
* Changing the CSS height was simpler than he thought, could use a brush up on CSS
* Atom work flow was not as clean as it should have been and slowed down progress (why not do the assessment using VIM?)
* Communication was good, could use a little more "why" and not just "what"
