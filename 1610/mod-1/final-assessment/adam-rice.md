## Final Assessment: Adam Rice

### Evaluator: Robbie

### Notes
* Good with changing the height of the form container after adding more input fields
* Struggled with the default value, saw some slight syntax errors (between assignment and equivalence), made a function that didn't return any values (so the result was NaN), but eventually caught all of these and got the default number of diners to work
* Completed phase one and started phase two
* Good use of variable assignments and jQuery selection was practiced well
