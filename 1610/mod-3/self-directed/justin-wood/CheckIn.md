## Reflection

  - What was the context for this project? (ie: was this a side project? was this for Turing? was this for an experiment?) - This is a Mod 3 Turing self-directed project.
  - What did you set out to build? - An app to recommend boardgames based on games you already like.
  - Why was this project challenging and therefore a really good learning experience? - Project is challenging because I'm working with an API that doesn't give me everything I need. So, instead I'm building a scraper to build my own database with the data I need to recommend boardgames.
  - What were some unexpected obstacles? - The API doesn't give me the information I need.
  - What tools did you use to implement this project? - Selenium, React, Webpack, Redux, Router.
      - This might seem obvious because you are IN this codebase, but to all other humans now is the time to talk about why you chose webpack instead of create react app, or D3, or vanilla JS instead of a framework etc. Brag about your choices and justify them here. - Webpack was already built into my react boilerplate.
