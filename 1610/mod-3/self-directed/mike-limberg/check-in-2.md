### Student: Mike Limberg

#### Check In: 2

#### Project Name: Bracket Builder

#### Client: Spikeball tournaments

### Deliverables:  sick app that allows you to build a tournament, update scores/bracket, see updates realtime. 

##### Now that you have started building your app, what are the frameworks/additional modules/technologies/testing frameworks you are using, list those here (ALL of them).
* React/Redux
* Firebase (wanted to implement a small backend myself to learn about it time permitting but it looks like time may not permit...)
* Brought in a InlineEdit NPM module for inline editing functionality

##### Based on the MVP you stated in the first check in template, list what you have accomplished, and what still needs to be done.  
* Ability to build a tournament with basic parameters, rename teams, randomize matchups. Next steps are storing the tournament information and building the bracket. Oh and CSS.

##### The next check in will be Monday/Tuesday. Based on unexpected challenges and/or unexpected progress adjust your MVP to reflect what you can get done by your next check in.  

##### What is on fire/what are you having trouble with?
Nothing so far, worried the bracket display will be tricky but looking forward to the challenge!

### Screen Shots of Current State Of App  
It's just plain text and buttons, so I'll spare you the lameness.
