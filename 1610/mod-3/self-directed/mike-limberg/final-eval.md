### Feature Delivery

**1. Completion**

* 3: Developer completed all the user stories and requirements set during check-ins. (Lots of complex data problems in this app; did a good job making it through those to deliver a cohesive MVP.)

**2. Organization**

// Not Required

* 3: Developer used a project management tool to keep their project organized.

### Technical Quality

**1. Test-Driven Development**

* 3: Project shows adequate testing (90% - 95% coverage). (Good prioritization of testing actions/reducers to include significant code coverage without struggling through component testing in the last hour.)

**2. Code Quality**

* 3: Project demonstrates solid code quality, proper abstractions, and reduced duplication. (Overall a good job solving the complicated problems this application presented, but with more time would love to see some refactoring at the component level to keep things modular and easier to maintain.)

### Product Experience

**1. User Experience**

* 3: Project exhibits a production-ready user experience. (Any necessary user-feedback is available during the interactions for the app; can still use some polishing but did a good job prioritizing the important styling.)

**2. Performance**

* 3: Project pages load on average under 400 milliseconds.
