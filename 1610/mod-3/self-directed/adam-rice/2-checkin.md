#### Primed

##### Now that you have started building your app, what are the frameworks/additional modules/technologies/testing frameworks you are using, list those here (ALL of them).

AngularJS 1, Sass  

##### Based on the MVP you stated in the first check in template, list what you have accomplished, and what still needs to be done.

Accomplished displaying both weather and unique gif on each weather-day-card.  

Still needs gh-pages support(getting errors due to api call), accessibility, testing, a button that randomly sets the theme for the user, and clicking on an image takes the user to the gif-url.  

##### What is on fire/what are you having trouble with?

Have not looked into testing yet.
