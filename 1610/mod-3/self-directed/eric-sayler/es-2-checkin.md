### Student:

#### Check In: 2

#### Project Name: Run Spot

#### Client: n/a

### Deliverables:

##### Now that you have started building your app, what are the frameworks/additional modules/technologies/testing frameworks you are using, list those here (ALL of them).  
- Get User's private playlists showing up (not just saved tracks)
- Pull in all of user's tracks for each playlist (not just the first 50 or so)
- Use some third party components (such as table component) to speed up implementation
- Add Redux


##### Based on the MVP you stated in the first check in template, list what you have accomplished, and what still needs to be done.  
- Need to pull in Audio Features (which include tempo metadata) for each track
- Need to hold sorted state of playlists and tracks in Redux
- Need to be able to submit new playlist in correct order to Spotify's create new playlist/add tracks to playlist API endpoints


##### The next check in will be Monday/Tuesday. Based on unexpected challenges and/or unexpected progress adjust your MVP to reflect what you can get done by your next check in.

- Add Redux/Thunk
- Get user Playlists showing up and tracks for each playlist with BPM data


##### What is on fire/what are you having trouble with?
- async calls for each track
