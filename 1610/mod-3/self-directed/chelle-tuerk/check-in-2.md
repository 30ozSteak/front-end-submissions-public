I am now successfully hitting the Spotify audio endpoint that requires OAuth.  I am securely logging in a user.

I've styles a bit using sass and rendering images on the screen.  (I had lost this ability between the first check in and this one!)

I still need to find a way to actually play the audio clip. And I would like to be able to pulg the artist name into another api that will find a venue where the artist is playing.  I still have yet to receive a response from ReverbNation--I've emailed them 3 times now trying to track down the correct individual to speak with.

I need to define more routes also.

I would like to continue styling the app.

I'm not currently hitting any pain points, but I just yesterday hit the OAuth endpoint--so I expect to run into complications to actually make the clip audible.
