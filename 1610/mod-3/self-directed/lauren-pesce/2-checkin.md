### Student: Lauren Pesce

#### Check In: 2

#### Project Name: ColorPal

#### Client: Taylor

### Deliverables:  

##### Now that you have started building your app, what are the frameworks/additional modules/technologies/testing frameworks you are using, list those here (ALL of them). 
 React-Redux, dropzone, color-thief, SASS, enzyme, mocha, chai.

##### Based on the MVP you stated in the first check in template, list what you have accomplished, and what still needs to be done.  
I have dropzone working so I can drag and drop my photos and display them and I finally figured out how to make color-thief ES6 compatible, so color-thief is installed and giving me back a color palette. 

I need to display the color palette, make a delete button work, make a favorites page that works, a favorites button that works, login using firebase, and route everything. Testing and CSS need to be done. 

##### The next check in will be Monday/Tuesday. Based on unexpected challenges and/or unexpected progress adjust your MVP to reflect what you can get done by your next check in.  
I will have a color palette rendering to the screen, along with a favorites and delete button. I would also like to have some CSS and testing done. 

##### What is on fire/what are you having trouble with?
Timing is the biggest problem, I'm worried about getting the favorites page properly working, along with a properly working login using firebase.
