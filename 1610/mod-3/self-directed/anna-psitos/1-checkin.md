#### Project Pitch
    - This app will help you choose where to go for happy hour when you can't make a decision.It takes in your preferred neighborhood and beverage of choice and will randomly choose from the venues that meet those criteria.

### Wireframes
    - Include screenshots to wireframes of EVERY PAGE of the MVP of your app

#### Frameworks
    - React, Redux, possibly Firebase and React Native

#### APIs
    - Link to any API docs that you are planning on using
    - What requirements does this API have to make requests? (ie: google APIs require the request be sent from an `https` protocol.)
    - If the API blows up or requires a back end, how will you mock out your data at first?

#### MVP
    - A web app that will help you decide where to go for happy hour. There will be three pages: front page has a list of neighborhoods and beverage choices. The second page will be the spinning wheel with a button that will cut the spinning short (this will be triggered when the user clicks the select button and will change to the third page on a timeout). The third page will be the results of the random selection and will display name, hours, address, and what is on happy hour.

#### RVP
    - Users will be able to sign in and save favorites, enabling them to choose from their list of favorites rather than all the options. If interested, users will be able to post where they are going and be able to meet up with others. There will also be a mobile version that will be done in React Native.

#### Collaborators
    - None, this is a solo project
