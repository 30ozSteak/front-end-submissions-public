Student: Mike Ziccardi

Check In: 2

Project Name: How's it Taste

Client: The person using this app will be the folks who usually use apps like yelp to find places worth eating at

Deliverables:

Now that you have started building your app, what are the frameworks/additional modules/technologies/testing frameworks you are using, list those here (ALL of them).

  I need to start implementing firebase so the user can mark a restaurant as visited, and let them make notes on restaurant. will be using jest to test functionality. using react router to move around the app

Based on the MVP you stated in the first check in template, list what you have accomplished, and what still needs to be done.
  i am able to get a list of current close restaurants, and when i click on them i get a list of 5 reviews(limits of api. questions to the developer team at zomato have been emailed to them) of that restaurant.

The next check in will be Monday/Tuesday. Based on unexpected challenges and/or unexpected progress adjust your MVP to reflect what you can get done by your next check in.

hopefully get some sort of firebase functionality

What is on fire/what are you having trouble with?
firebase is scary and I don't like it. I imagine that is where I will run into a majority of my problems
