#### Project Pitch
    - My father started a site in 1997 called GoAbroad.com which is a directory for alternative travel: study, volunteer, intern, jobs, and degrees abroad. Because of this study abroad and travel have been a central part of my life, and recently my dad and I watched Michael Moore's new documentary: "Where to Invade Next". The premise is Michael Moore goes to several different countries and takes their best ideas to import back to America, like Norway's prison system which treats prisoners more like rehab patients than prisoners, or France where every public school has three course lunches, or Italy where they have mandatory paid 8 weeks vacation a year. At a certain point he goes to Slovenia to talk to college students about how college is completely free, and it's one of about a dozen countries that offers full degrees for free or very close to free. For my personal project I'd like to create a web app/site where a user can pick a country and it shows the options of getting a full university degree for free and the requirements to go there. I'd like to see if a back end student would want to pair with me on creating a server/database of countries to do this in, and maybe creating an SEO search algorithm to avoid having to spend hours and hours of research. Here's the snippet from the movie: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGpXnSRX2CY"

#### Frameworks
    - FE: React Redux, Sass  BE: Ruby on Rails

#### APIs
    - https://www.numbeo.com/common/api.jsp
    - Internal API to database that holds our info
    - My partner is building a backend API for our internal database that will allow me to access our data


#### MVP
    - Minimum Viable Product: A website where a user can click on a region, then a country, then a university that holds some information and a link to the official website

#### RVP
    - Reach Viable Product: Phase 1:
BE: Database design, what info to pull in, what API are we going to use
FE: Get one thing rendering from our database, build out boilerplate in react redux: maybe selecting a country and seeing the universities

Phase 2:
BE: Web scraping
FE: Styling, display basic requirements for university

Phase 3:
FE: Really nice SASS/styling, easy user flow

MVP:
FE: An app where a user can select a country, then select a university, and see price, requirements, and if the classes are in English
BE: Database that FE can call with 15-20 top options
