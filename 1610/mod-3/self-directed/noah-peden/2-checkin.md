### Student: Noah Peden

#### Check In: 2

#### Project Name: Global Degree For Free

#### Client: Brenna/Prospective College Students

### Deliverables:  
Phase 1 (this is probably where I'm at now):
BE: Database design, what info to pull in, what API are we going to use
FE: Get one thing rendering from our database, build out boilerplate in react redux: maybe selecting a country and seeing the universities

Phase 2:
BE: Web scraping
FE: Styling, display basic requirements for university

Phase 3:
FE: Really nice SASS/styling, easy user flow

MVP:
FE: An app where a user can select a country, then select a university, and see price, requirements, and if the classes are in English
BE: Database that FE can call with 15-20 top options

##### Now that you have started building your app, what are the frameworks/additional modules/technologies/testing frameworks you are using, list those here (ALL of them).  

React Redux, Router 2-3, jest/chai/enzyme, BE in Ruby on Rails

##### Based on the MVP you stated in the first check in template, list what you have accomplished, and what still needs to be done.  

Front page UI basics are set up along with router, still waiting on API from backend partner, but she says it's very close to being done. Until then I'll start mocking out data and using another API from a free travel website to practice displaying data and get some of my main functions set up with store.

##### The next check in will be Monday/Tuesday. Based on unexpected challenges and/or unexpected progress adjust your MVP to reflect what you can get done by your next check in.  

I hope to have all of my data displaying into the correct routes and components into individual cards.

##### What is on fire/what are you having trouble with?
Nothing yet honestly. Just trying to remember how functions work with Redux, but it'll be fine by the end of today I'm sure.

This includes the drop down menus for each region, and when you click on a region it's getting data back.
