Student: DAN GRUND

Check In: 2

Project Name: VAPORGROOVES

Client: 90s Nostalgia Ultra Kids

Deliverables:

I am using react, react-router, howler js, and p5js. 

I have the app framed out, the drum machine logic built out, router set up properly, and have a plan for all the features I need to finish.
1. build out the audio player in App.js using a react wrapper for howler-js. 
2. build the visualizer. as an MVP, I want to have a circle generate at the center of the canvas and expand outwards every time a 
sample is triggered, a different color corresponding to each sound. if time allows I'll build more complicated visuals but want to 
build these other features first.
3. hidden keyboard. this one will actually use p5 since it only lives on the p5 canvas page. neat! 2 different sound libraries! such learning opportunity!
4. the sha key to URL based on the drumrack state.
5. ability to add additional drumracks
6. modify loop length
7. modify tempo
8. add a filter bank next to the visualizer. 


The next check in will be Monday/Tuesday. Based on unexpected challenges and/or unexpected progress adjust your MVP to reflect what you can get done by your next check in.
honestly I should have everything above done tuesday, though I'll probably need help with the SHA url hash setup.
