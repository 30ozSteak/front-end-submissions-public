### Student:Stephanie Andrews

#### Check In: 2

#### Project Name: Community Connections

#### Client: Seniors and College Students

### Deliverables:  

##### Now that you have started building your app, what are the frameworks/additional modules/technologies/testing frameworks you are using, list those here (ALL of them).  
react-redux-form
lodash (maybe)


##### Based on the MVP you stated in the first check in template, list what you have accomplished, and what still needs to be done.  
Everything still needs to be done.  I've spent most of my time focused on meeting the other expectations earlier this week and struggled with the setup- started to use react redux starter kit but decided it would be better to make my own boilerplate, then struggled with that...   Now I have that but am not sure how to best structure everything- Should I make the framework for the dream version or the mvp- what do either of those look like...  

##### The next check in will be Monday/Tuesday. Based on unexpected challenges and/or unexpected progress adjust your MVP to reflect what you can get done by your next check in.  
I'm sticking with the original MVP...

##### What is on fire/what are you having trouble with?
I have to relearn redux...
Managing my worrying and losing cognitive energy/motivation because of it...
