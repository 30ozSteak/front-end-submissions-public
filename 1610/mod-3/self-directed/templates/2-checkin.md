### Student: Devin Beliveau

#### Check In: 2

#### Project Name: NYT Bookshelf

#### Client: Brenna

### Deliverables:  

##### Frameworks / Technologies

This app is built with React / Redux, local storage and Sass. Phase two will involve either Firebase or a custom back end.

##### MVP Progress

Currently a user can select one of the popular NYT Bestseller lists and view the title, author, description and book cover (if available). Styling is about 90% complete.

To Dos Functionaity: 
-Set up a way for user to save favorites to local storage and display those when favorites list is selected. 

To Dos Styling: 
-Figure out a way to display a 'no cover available' if book doesn't have an associated bookcover.
-Have selected book list tab stay highighted.

##### The next check in will be Monday/Tuesday. Based on unexpected challenges and/or unexpected progress adjust your MVP to reflect what you can get done by your next check in. 

I would like to focus on the favorites / local storage next since that is the main functionality of the app that isn't completed.

##### What is on fire/what are you having trouble with?

I feel like I'm not really using Redux to it's full capacities.
