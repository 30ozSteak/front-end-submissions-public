#### Project Pitch
    ColorPal is an application that allows you to use your favorite pictures as inspiration for your next color palette. You just need to drag and drop your photo into the application and it gives you the most compatible 5 colors that are within the photo you provided. This includes the hex codes so you can use them in your code!

#### Frameworks
    Redux

#### APIs
  No APIs. Planning to use [color thief](https://github.com/lokesh/color-thief)
#### MVP
   Adding a photo to the app will give you a series of 5 colors with hex codes as a color palette. 

#### RVP
   I would like to use drag & drop to add photos to the page. The favorites page would display each photo, and a hover effect  that would show the palette colors. As an extention, I would love to make a mobile version that had access to the phone's camera so that photos could be taken directly.
