### Student:
Bekah Lundy
#### Check In: 2

#### Project Name:
Nourish
#### Client:
People who want to pursue happiness and a more balanced life by concentrating on a daily practice of four things. Physical health, emotional health, mental health, and spiritual health. (Me)
### Deliverables:  

##### Now that you have started building your app, what are the frameworks/additional modules/technologies/testing frameworks you are using, list those here (ALL of them).  
React, Redux, React Router 4, maybe google calendar api, SASS, enzyme, MAYBE firebase

##### Based on the MVP you stated in the first check in template, list what you have accomplished, and what still needs to be done.  
I have an app that is creating and checking off to do’s and a bar graph showing up and thats basically it. I need to have the filter buttons actually filter and add icons when they are added and to make an about page

##### The next check in will be Monday/Tuesday. Based on unexpected challenges and/or unexpected progress adjust your MVP to reflect what you can get done by your next check in.  
I want to have an about page, and the goals list working in the way that we had talked about.

##### What is on fire/what are you having trouble with?
There is a TON of stuff to do by the end of next week, so I’m pretty stressed out about everything. Feeling pretty on fire.
