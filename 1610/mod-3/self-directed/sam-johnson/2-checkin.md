### Student: Sam Johnson

#### Check In: 2

#### Project Name: SchoolFinder

#### Client: Denver pre-K through 12 parents

### Deliverables: A single-page web application

##### Now that you have started building your app, what are the frameworks/additional modules/technologies/testing frameworks you are using, list those here (ALL of them).  
Same as reported before:
- React / Redux / Sass / Firebase
- Google Maps JS API / Google Maps Directions API

##### Based on the MVP you stated in the first check in template, list what you have accomplished, and what still needs to be done.  
- basic app build w/ Router and Redux set and ready to be built out/manipulated as needed
- Google map rendering correctly
- current have marker displaying as test for future work
- sign-in hooked up
- currently exploring Directions API

##### The next check in will be Monday/Tuesday. Based on unexpected challenges and/or unexpected progress adjust your MVP to reflect what you can get done by your next check in.  
- I would like to have all functionality completed by Tuesday so Wednesday can be focused on testing and styling

##### What is on fire/what are you having trouble with?
I don't ahve anything on fire right now but do have some big hurdles I'll be working through.  Mainly:
- Managing the Google Maps Direction API calls - I'd like to discuss my initial thoughts here with you and get feedback on the overal design AND if performance could be an issue
- Hooking up Redux - Im not concerned about the technical aspect on this but the time it may take and want to discuss if you think I need to use Redux for this Project
- Anything else I might be missing here?
