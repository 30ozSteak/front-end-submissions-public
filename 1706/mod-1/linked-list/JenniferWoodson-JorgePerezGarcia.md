## Evaluator: Louisa
## Notes/What To Work On:

- Good work! Really nice execution of the UI, good choices for additional UI elements
- no git or github used, shared code via slack or on a jump drive -- not a sustainable way of working, both really need to quickly gain comfort with git and github and make sure they use it moving forward. It won't get easier until you use it!
- CSS needs some polish, but demonstrates a good attention to detail and a lot of care
- HTML is well thought through
- JS is in a good place for refactoring and could use a clean up pass
