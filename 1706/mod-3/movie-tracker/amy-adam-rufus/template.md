### notes:

- reach for the smallest thing first (easiest)
- be mindful of how you are looping through data and how that effects performance
- fix your login reducer. 

## Rubric

### Specification Adherence

<!-- - 3 - The application completes all 2 iterations. -->
- 2.5 - The application is in a usable state, but is missing some of the features outlined in the specification above.


### Code Quality

- 3 - Developer appears comfortable in React. There are minor opportunities to refactor.

### CSS/Design


- 3 - Developer has made a targeted effort to make the app appealing and user friendly. Evaluator has multiple recommendations for design changes. Follows majority of the [10 Essential Usability Guidelines.](https://speckyboy.com/10-essential-web-application-usability-guidelines/)

### Testing

- 3,5 - Almost all components are tested to a level that indicates developer has an understanding of testing

### PropType Implementation

- Pass - Proptype validation is implemented for any component receiving props.


### 5. Code Sanitation

The output from ESLint showsâ€¦

<!-- * 4 - Zero complaints
* 3 - Five or fewer complaints
* 2 - Six to ten complaints -->
* 1 - More than ten complaints

### Redux Architecture

* 3: At least one component is not connected with Redux appropriately. Application state is mutated by more than just Redux. The Redux store is missing application data that it should be handling.

### Routing

* 3: Application is a single page and uses the React Router but does not display the appropriate components upon navigating.

### Workflow

- 4 - Developer(s) make many small, atomic commits that clearly document the evolution of the application and do not contain irrelevant changesets that aren't reflected by the commit message. Commit messages are concise and consistent in syntax and tense. Developer(s) effectively use git branches and pull requests when applicable to incorporate changes into the application, and are not pushing directly to master. There are no instances where the developer(s) have committed source code that should be .gitignored. There are no instances of "dead" or commented-out code and debugger statements like console.log.
