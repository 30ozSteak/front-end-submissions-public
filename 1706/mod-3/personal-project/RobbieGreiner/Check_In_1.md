## Project Name: Brewery Tracker

#### Check In: 1

#### Project Pitch

A place to view info on all breweries in Denver. Home page lets you choose to see all breweries, see all beer types, see breweries by Area.  Once a brewery is clicked, user will see Location, beers, beer types, logo, description. Clicking on a beer will show details on the beer type and glass to be poured in.

### Deliverables

#### Order Of Attack
* Oct 24th - Create all endpoint URLs that I will need, almost done. Wireframe.  Starting playing with data in application.
* Oct 25th - Play with data inside of application, figure out how I want the data sets to be structured in my app.
         - Getting the data for all the breweries and then getting the data for their beers is to separate API calls, but
           I would like that data to live in the same object.
* Oct 26th - Setup landing page, setup components
* Oct 27th - See some data in components
* Oct 28-29 - Go to breweries for more inspiration, setup testing environment



#### MVP
A website with all the breweries from Denver and see all their beers with descriptions.
Clean and appealing design.

#### Nice To Haves
Integrete google maps api to show brewery location.

#### Biggest Challenges
Getting the data to behave exactly how I want to will be time consuming.
Requires multiple fetch calls for the data sets that I want.
Being efficient in Redux. 
Not getting stuck on one thing for too long.
