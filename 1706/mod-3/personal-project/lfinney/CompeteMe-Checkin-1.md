## Project Name: CompeteMe

#### Check In: 1

#### Project Pitch: 
In recent decades, pick-up sports competitions have become ways for individuals to build community and get some exercise, while engaging in a a bit of friendly competition in the process. However, the "pick-up" nature of relying on word of mouth and strangers to come to together at a park keeps pick-up sports communities small. I believe that more people would play in these types of events if the process were more streamlined. I know I would. CompeteMe seeks to do just that. Allow a user to pick a park, create a competion, and invites others to join them.

### Deliverables

#### Stack:
React, Router, Redux

#### APIs:
Google Places API

#### Wireframes:
- I have some things sketched up on paper, but nothing digital yet. I found success in mod 1 doing paper mockups for the static comps, which is why I started my wireframing process there.

#### Waffle & Github:
[Github Repo](https://github.com/lfinney/competeMe)
[Waffle Board](https://waffle.io/lfinney/competeMe)

#### Order Of Attack
1) Finalize wireframe
2) Setup routes to major sections of page
3) Begin building wireframe in app using react components while also installing necessary dependencies
4) Successfully make an API call to Google Places and see if I can actually get the maps I want
5) Build out components more and see if I can get a map to appear on a card
6) Create controlled form components for both user profile and event submission
7) Set-up Redux store where info from controlled form components can be placed (Should I set this up earlier?)
8) Have event cards populating from store

#### MVP
- Users can create and join sporting events
- When creating an event a user should be able to pick a sport, select a number of participants, select a time of day, and select a park to play at using Google Maps Places API. 
- Whatever park is selected by the user it should display on the event card.
- There should be a user profile page.
- There should be three places for an event card to live. In all places, these cards should be in chronological order:
  - Upcoming
  - In progress
  - Completed

#### Nice To Haves
- Local storage functioning well is a "nice to have" that I'm really pushing for.
- I would love for this project to eventually have a backend and users can store their "preferred parks" on their account. Then, if another user makes an event at one of their "preferred parks" they'd recieve a notification. I know that's super unrealisitc for this two week sprint, but that's where my heads at for how this could scale.

#### Biggest Challenges
- I imagine that getting the maps to appear on the card with a given park will be the hardest part of the project. I can anticipate how to do everything else with our all our knowledge from class so far.
