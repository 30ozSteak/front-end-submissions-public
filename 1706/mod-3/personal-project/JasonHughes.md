Project Name: One Star	

Check In: 1

Project Pitch: Generally, I am pretty optimistic. I think itâ€™s really funny looking up 1 star reviews on Yelp and seeing what others are complaining about, and for what reasons. I am going to build an app that live updates 1 star reviews near your current location.
