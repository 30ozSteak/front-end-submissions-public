#### Order Of Attack
0. Stub backend
1. Home page with info about the business linking to a login page allowing both homeowner login as well as business owner login
2. Home owner login has the ability to fill out a form requesting services on their house. Request should send an email to home owner to as a record of request. The subbmitted request should also email business owner as well as well as be visible in a "messages" section of the business owner login. Business owner should be able to set a time and date and schedule the request to a gmail calendar. Once scheduled an email should be sent to homeowner with details. 
3. Business owner should be have the ability to create an invoice. Upon submission the invoice should be saved to the home and generate an email to the homeowner. 
4. next set of features - see nice to haves
