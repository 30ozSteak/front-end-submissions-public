# Instructor Evaluation Points: Game Time
# Instructor: Leta
# Comments:
  * Excellent testing (also great it was used as a learning tool)
  * Get rid of anonymous numbers :) Utilize parameters to reduce redundancy
  * Good code organization
  * Fun interface!

## Functional Expectations

* 3.5 - Application is fully playable without crashes or bugs

### User Interface

* 3.5 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality.

### Testing

* 4 - Project has a running test suite that exercises the application at multiple levels. The test suite covers almost all aspects of the application and uses mocks and stubs when appropriate.

### JavaScript Style

* 3 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

### Workflow

* 3.5 - The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.

### Code Sanitation

The output from JSHint showsâ€¦

* 4 - Zero complaints
