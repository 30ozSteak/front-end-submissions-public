# Code Quality

#### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub that you are proud of
[happy code](https://github.com/ameseee/palette-picker/blob/master/public/js/scripts.js#L107-L115)

* Why were you proud of this piece of code?
I liked pulling out the payload body here to keep the fetch function cleaner. 

#### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub that you feel not great about
[sad code](https://github.com/ameseee/palette-picker/blob/master/public/js/scripts.js#L70-L105)

* Why do you feel not awesome about the code? What challenges did you face trying to write/refactor it?
I feel less than awesome because this is repeating the same thing five times in a row. I refactored other things before tacking this because of the palette_color_# challenge. I still want to refactor it!

#### Attach a screenshot or paste the output from your terminal of the result of your test-suite running.

#### Link to Design Inspiration

[Inspiration](https://dribbble.com/shots/3002953-Famous-Industry-pages)
I liked how much the colors on this popped, and I wanted my Palette Picker to allow the colors the user chose to really stand out and not drown in any of MY design.

#### Please feel free to ask any other questions or make any other statements below!

What is convention for organizing the server.js file - all the gets together, then posts together, etc. or organized by endpoint? Or is this just a preference/team consistency thing?

I'm sure you're planning to include in the feedback, but I'm wondering if I made the right choices for my endpoints? I originally had several more that I starting realizing I didn't need. Looking back I think I maybe should have done a 'POST' directly to /palettes rather than /projects/:id/palettes, but honestly am not 100% sure. 

I have an error on line 43 (TypeError: Cannot read property 'project_name' of undefined). When I append a new project, my theory is that is takes a second because of async, so project is undefined. Somehow it still 'works' though. I feel like I need to understand how I can get the error and console.log to see that project is undefined, but it still 'works'.
