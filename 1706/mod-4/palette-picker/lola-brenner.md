## Completion

#### Were you able to complete the base functionality?

Yes! 

If not, explain what is missing and why.

#### Which extensions, if any, did you complete?

I did not complete any extensions.

# Code Quality

#### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub that you are proud of
[happy code](https://github.com/lolakoala/palette-picker/blob/master/public/scripts/scripts.js#L21-L42)

* Why were you proud of this piece of code?

Each project gets it's own palettes on page load, and then puts the colors of each palette into an array. I map through the array to create an html tag for each color, and then I append it to the page. I thought this was a sleek solution to appending the color palettes.

#### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub that you feel not great about
[sad code](https://github.com/lolakoala/palette-picker/blob/master/public/scripts/scripts.js#L66-L94)

* Why do you feel not awesome about the code? What challenges did you face trying to write/refactor it?

In this code, I'm toggling the lock img attributes on click of both the color div and the image. I expected it to work on the img (which is inside the div) without having to code it on click due to event bubbling... When it did not behave as expected, I basically had to duplicated some code and change the selector. I was nervous about refactoring this into one function because the code is just different enough that I'm not sure what I would pass in to handle that.

#### Attach a screenshot or paste the output from your terminal of the result of your test-suite running.

12 passing (513ms)
  1 failing

  1) Uncaught error outside test suite:
     Uncaught Error: listen EADDRINUSE :::3000


#### Link to Design Inspiration

* Show us what you used as design inspiration (another color picker site, a dribbble UI element, a user flow, etc.) and explain what you stole from it

[art bag image](https://dribbble.com/shots/313499-Artist-Bag-Icon)

I was inspired by this image to make my app art-themed. I envision my app being used by art students/teachers.

[circles image](https://dribbble.com/shots/1710723-Brawker-The-new-color-palette)

I use a lot of circles and rounded corners in my designs, but these circles really helped me envision how I wanted the random color palette to look. I found this before the art supplies bag, so when I found that I ended up placing the circles on the paint palette image.

#### Please feel free to ask any other questions or make any other statements below!

Anything else you wanna say!

The design of this project was a lot of fun! I am enjoying learning about the backend.

# Instructor Feedback (Brittany)

## Specification Adherence

**40 points**: (50 possible points) There is one feature missing from the base expectations that makes the application feel incomplete or hard to use.

* I'm noticing when I click on a lock icon, it doesn't actually lock the color in place. Every time I generate a new palette, it continues to change all 5 colors.

* When I click on a pre-existing palette that has been saved, it should update the main palette UI to display those colors. Doesn't seem to be doing that at the moment.

## User Interface

**x points**: (20 possible points)

* Creative UI! Love the paint palette. The lock icons are maybe a little difficult to decipher...I think if I didn't have any context on the project I'm not sure I would know they were locks that I could/should click on.

* When there are no projects in place, the drop down menu for selecting a project is completely empty. Would be nice to have a placeholder here at least that says something like 'Select a Project...' even if there were no projects to choose from. Otherwise it's a little tricky to tell what that drop-down is for.

* When I first start filling out the projects panel with new projects, the project name shows up all the way at the bottom of that div which looks a little bizarre. It fills out nicely once there are about 5 projects in place, but it'd be nice to have everything looking solid no matter what amount of data you have in place. 

* You generally want to avoid having little containers (like the projects element) that have vertical and horizontal scroll bars. I know you don't have a ton of control over the vertical height of the projects section, but the horizontal you could probably remove that extra scrollbar with `overflow: hidden`, and put a limit on the length of a project/palette name. Set a fixed width (or all percentage-based widths) on that element and all of it's children to ensure the width isn't bouncing around based on what kind of content exists.
