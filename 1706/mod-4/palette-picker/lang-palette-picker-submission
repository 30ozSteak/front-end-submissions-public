# Code Quality

#### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub that you are proud of
[happy code](https://github.com/francylang/palette-picker/blob/master/public/js/scripts.js#46-54)
* I like this piece of code because I broke out the logic for the append and fetch palettes function. This eliminated nested fetch calls within the fetch projects function. 

#### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub that you feel not great about
[sad code](https://github.com/francylang/palette-picker/blob/master/public/js/scripts.js#57-92)

* This piece of code is a bit ugly. I would like to do some refactoring and reduce the size of the append. I have not quite figured out how I can iterate through the append and build the div. 


#### Attach a screenshot or paste the output from your terminal of the result of your test-suite running.

[test suite](Coming Soon)

#### Link to Design Inspiration
http://palettab.com/
* I really liked the horizontal color block aside, so I used that to ground my application and build the UI from there. 

#### Please feel free to ask any other questions or make any other statements below!

* I've seen how done is used in testing, but I am not exactly sure where it comes from and why it some times causes my test suite to timeout.
