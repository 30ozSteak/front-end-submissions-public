## Completion

#### Were you able to complete the base functionality?
Missing:~~Folder names must be unique (you should not be able to create two folders with the same name), annotated server.js file, testing- not fully tested, yet~~
~~I ran out of time.~~

Yes

#### Which extensions, if any, did you complete?
* User can edit the hex code in the aside palette and update to the new color. 

# Code Quality

#### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub that you are proud of
[happy code](https://github.com/francylang/palette-picker/blob/master/public/js/scripts.js#38-47)
* I like this piece of code because I broke out the logic for the append and fetch palettes function. This eliminated nested fetch calls within the fetch projects function. 

#### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub that you feel not great about
[sad code](https://github.com/francylang/palette-picker/blob/master/public/js/scripts.js#126-142)

* I would like to see if there is a way to check for duplicates within my main project fetch/post instead of doing two fetch calls to projects. I haven't had success, yet. I am not able to figure out how to get the response and then make the post if there are not duplicates without fetching again. 

#### Attach a screenshot or paste the output from your terminal of the result of your test-suite running.

#### Link to Design Inspiration
http://palettab.com/
* I really liked the horizontal color block aside, so I used that to ground my application and build the UI from there. 

#### Please feel free to ask any other questions or make any other statements below!

* I've seen how done is used in testing, but I am not exactly sure where it comes from and why it some times causes my test suite to timeout.
