## Completion

#### Were you able to complete the base functionality?

I do not have a functionality to make sure all 5 randomly generated colors are unique. I simply forgot about this feature for a while and then ran out of time.

#### Which extensions, if any, did you complete?
none

# Code Quality

#### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub that you are proud of
[happy code](https://github.com/jenPlusPlus/palette-picker/blob/master/public/js/scripts.js#L119-L125)

* Why were you proud of this piece of code?
This is the first time I successfully added an alert to HTML, rather than using alert();.

#### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub that you feel not great about
[sad code](https://github.com/jenPlusPlus/palette-picker/blob/master/public/js/scripts.js#L53-L59)

* Why do you feel not awesome about the code? What challenges did you face trying to write/refactor it?
I don't like that I'm repeating the same line with a different number each time. I think I could use a loop to add these lines, but I did not have time to refactor this code.

#### Attach a screenshot or paste the output from your terminal of the result of your test-suite running.

#### Link to Design Inspiration

* Show us what you used as design inspiration (another color picker site, a dribbble UI element, a user flow, etc.) and explain what you stole from it
[design inspiration](https://codepen.io/team/lincolnloop/pen/QwQwza)
I really liked the box shadow on the palette, so I applied it to my destop-size UI.

I thought this project was really fun! I appreciate the simplicity of the backend.
