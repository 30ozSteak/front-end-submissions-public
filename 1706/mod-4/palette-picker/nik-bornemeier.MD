* I liked the way everything was very dark EXCEPT for the colors, I felt like with an app like this your eye should only be drawn to the colors.


#### Please feel free to ask any other questions or make any other statements below!

I really learned quite a bit with this project, but I dont' think it will be ready for grading until tomorrow sometime :(

# Instructor Feedback (Brittany)

## Specification Adherence

**50 points**: (50 possible points) No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use. Data persists on refresh using a knex/postgreSQL database.

## User Interface

**13 points**: (20 possible points) User interface is mostly intuitive, though the instructor might need some guidance on interactions. Styling is mostly consistent, but could use some clean up. Application may be missing some relevant feedback that would help guide the user.

* Bug where some HEX values are only saving 5 digits instead of 6, causing the color to not show up

* When I create a new project, I should be able to see it in the drop-down menu immediately. Instead I have to refresh the page.

* Any save/generate/delete buttons should turn the cursor into a hand icon when you hover over them to further indicate that they are clickable.

* Definitely need some more padding/margins in the projects section around the palettes and their names

* I like the creativity of having all the boxes of different colors for displaying a palette, but it's almost a little too jarring to effectively see how the colors would work together. I think it works in the main content area with the big version for generating a new palette, but in the projects sidebar I'd probably simplify it to a single horizontal bar of the colors side-by-side.

## Testing

**18 points**: (20 possible points) Project has a running test suite that tests every server-side endpoint with many happy and sad path cases.

* Testing [all of these assertions](https://github.com/NikBorn/mod4-Palette-Picker/blob/master/test/routes.spec.js#L83-L144) is a little excessive. There's also no guarantee that your data will come back in any particular order, so relying on the index of an array element to assert it's values might intermittently fail. I'd rather you test one element from the array and assert that the array contains a particular object with certain values.

* You wouldn't send through an [id](https://github.com/NikBorn/mod4-Palette-Picker/blob/master/test/routes.spec.js#L166) during a POST request naturally, so don't do it in your tests either. Just assert that the returned response is a 201 with an id property, don't worry about the value.

* Same [here](https://github.com/NikBorn/mod4-Palette-Picker/blob/master/test/routes.spec.js#L182) - just pass through an empty object. You want your tests to mimic real-world environments as closely as possible.
