# Code Quality

#### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub that you are proud of
[happy code 1](https://github.com/AdamMescher/palette-picker/blob/master/server.js#L67-L87)

* It was interesting learning about the .first() method which allows a query to stop at the first found item rather than iterate through the entire column.

[happy code 2](https://github.com/AdamMescher/palette-picker/blob/master/public/js/scripts.js#L283-L291)

* It was fun figuring out the animation for continued rotation of the button and color wheel.

#### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub that you feel not great about
[sad code](https://github.com/AdamMescher/palette-picker/blob/master/public/js/scripts.js#L49-L64)

* Why do you feel not awesome about the code? What challenges did you face trying to write/refactor it?

- This is not a pure function as it does multiple things, and since the promise resolves it still posts the project to the page. 

#### Attach a screenshot or paste the output from your terminal of the result of your test-suite running.
