## Completion

#### Were you able to complete the base functionality?

The missing items are
  - Testing
  - Design research implimentation 
  
 In the end I ran out of time. I struggled with some functionality which caused a time crunch I did not overcome.
 I will be finishing these over the weekend. 
  
#### Which extensions, if any, did you complete?

# Code Quality

#### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub that you are proud of
[happy code](https://github.com/bbp5280/palette-picker/blob/8afb0d04e9251a92b13430bc329846ad5c64e6a6/public/js/scripts.js#L27-L45)

I like this fetch function to retirve and build projects and palettes as it is mostly broken down into easy single functionality functions. 

#### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub that you feel not great about
[sad code](https://github.com/bbp5280/palette-picker/blob/8afb0d04e9251a92b13430bc329846ad5c64e6a6/public/js/scripts.js#L127-L146)

This is mostly a duplicate function. I am serving back the wrong data in the response to use the original. I know how to refactor this but did not get there. 

#### Attach a screenshot or paste the output from your terminal of the result of your test-suite running.
