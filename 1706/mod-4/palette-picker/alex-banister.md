#### Link to your annotated server file
[annotated server file](https://github.com/alexbanister/palette-picker/blob/comments/server.js)

## Completion

#### Were you able to complete the base functionality?

* Functionality complete. Couldn't complete tests. I have happy and sad paths for GET, POST, and DELETE projects but couldn't get palette endpoint tests to work. I think I was having a problem with the primary keys of projects and palettes auto incrementing and seed not resetting it. Tried adding .truncate() to the .del() in test seed file but psql won't let me do that. I tried .raw('ALTER SEQUENCE id RESET WITH 1') or something along those lines but also didn't work.

#### Which extensions, if any, did you complete?

* None, but I did add a random name suggestion to palettes and projects sort of the way repl does.

# Code Quality

#### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub that you are proud of
[happy code](https://github.com/alexbanister/palette-picker/blob/df99d3388b24b379f1208f903adec0bb52764c17/src/index.js#L99-L116)

* Building DOM elements seems to always get super messy. This function is a bit longer than I'd like and there is a bit more complexity than I like but I'm happy with it's cleanliness and readability.

#### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub that you feel not great about
[sad code](https://github.com/alexbanister/palette-picker/blob/df99d3388b24b379f1208f903adec0bb52764c17/src/index.js#L147-L165)

* This function kept growing as I developed and got messy, hard to read and does too much.

#### Attach a screenshot or paste the output from your terminal of the result of your test-suite running.

#### Link to Design Inspiration

[Inspiration](https://dribbble.com/shots/2761157-Brisk-Mate-Branding-Guidelines-Color-Pallete)

* I liked the "droplet" color dots and thought they would be a nice way to show colors and how they interact with the palette. the rest of the design was build around that.

#### Please feel free to ask any other questions or make any other statements below!

* Test seems better than DOM testing but still a bit squirrelly and I don't really understand how to debug tests and how to make them work consistently.

# Instructor Feedback (Brittany)

## Specification Adherence

**55 points**: (50 possible points) No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use. Data persists on refresh using a knex/postgreSQL database.

## User Interface

**17 points**: (20 possible points) User interface is mostly intuitive, though the instructor might need some guidance on interactions. Styling is mostly consistent, but could use some clean up.

* It feels a little difficult to tell that I'm saving a palette to a particular project -- I would maybe add that project drop down or 'current project' text somewhere closer to the 'Save Palette' button.

* I appreciate the logic that goes into showing the little teardrop-shaped colors on top of each background color for the palette, but it's a little more distracting than helpful. I also feel like 'Tt' might mean something significant but I wouldn't be able to guess exactly what. (I'm understand you're just demontrating text colors on background colors, but it's not super clear that's the intent.) I think you could incorporate the teardrop design in the thumbnails under the project sections rather than overlaying them on the larger background colors.

* Nice use of CSS transitions but I'd make them a little snappier. Subtlety is key with transitions and you want them to be just barely above the line of perception rather than something that's super obvious. (Kinda subliminal messaging. It will still have the intended effect of making DOM updates smoother, but it won't stand out as something users have to wait for to finish)
