# Code Quality

#### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub that you are proud of
[happy code](https://github.com/NikBorn/byob/blob/master/server.js#L29-L56)

* Why were you proud of this piece of code?

It handles the testing env as well as authentication and authorization in one function.

#### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub that you feel not great about
[sad code](https://github.com/NikBorn/byob/blob/master/test/routes.spec.js#L144-L151)

* Why do you feel not awesome about the code? What challenges did you face trying to write/refactor it?
We were not getting an error message back when testing this sad path, so we took out the validation for it so the test would pass.

#### Attach a screenshot or paste the output from your terminal of the result of your test-suite running.

# Instructor Feedback (Brittany)

The following set of points are distributed at the discretion of the instructor.

### Documentation

**7 points**:(10 possible points) The README includes documentation for all available endpoints and how to use them. Instructor can mostly follow the documentation for using the API.

//INTRO THE PROJECT!//

//INTRO THE PROJECT!//

//INTRO THE PROJECT!//

* ^ That could be a little more informative than it is...

* For your [post and patch requests](https://github.com/NikBorn/byob/blob/master/README.md#post-houses), I need to see an example of what kind of data I need to pass in with the request, not just the endpoint to be hit.

* Couple of typos here and there, but none that actually distract from the usage of the API
