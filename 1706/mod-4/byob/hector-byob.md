# Code Quality

#### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub that you are proud of

[happy code](https://github.com/hsanchez7934/hs-build-your-own-backend/blob/master/db/seeds/dev/watches.js)
Lines 4 through 25; functions createBrands and createWatch.

* Why were you proud of this piece of code?
Took me a while to figure out how to seed the large data set that I'm using.
The first few functions that I wrote were long and sloppy but in the end I was able to end up with a few lines
of code and the functions work the way I want them to.

#### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub that you feel not great about
[sad code](https://github.com/hsanchez7934/hs-build-your-own-backend/blob/master/test/routes.spec.js)
Lines 220 through 251

* Why do you feel not awesome about the code? What challenges did you face trying to write/refactor it?
  These test have been problematic. I've had issues trying to debug them.  The test that begins on 220 passes when I run npm 
  test, but when circle ci starts the build process, it fails.  The second test will not pass, the only error I get
  is that I need to ensure that I call done.  I need to refactor and debug so I can fix these issues.

# Instructor Feedback (Brittany)

The following set of points are distributed at the discretion of the instructor.

### Documentation

**7 points**: The README includes documentation for all available endpoints and how to use them. Instructor can mostly follow the documentation for using the API.

* There is very little formatting in the README which makes it a bit difficult to read, in some areas the heading formats aren't being parsed correctly. (The BYOB title for example)

* Generally you don't want to include images as part of your documentation for code...it's nice for people to be able to do a cmd+F to search for some text they're looking for. When you use images, it's impossible to do that.

* Glad you put in request body examples for your POST and PATCH requests, but I'd like you to be a little more explicit about what data type each property must be. I can infer based on the strings in the example, but it'd be nice to explicitly tell the user that.

### Feature Completion

**60 points**: Developer has implemented all 10 endpoints, 4 are secured via JWTs and one is a custom endpoint that filters data based on query params. The database is seeded with at least two tables and one relationship.

### Testing & Linting & Error Handling

**25 points**: Project has a running test suite that covers most happy and sad paths for each endpoint. Error handling has been implemented but does not cover all possible scenarios or is unhelpful for the end-user.

* Unless you're specifically calling `.order()` on your data when it's returned from the database, there's no guarantee that your data will come back in a particular order. That makes [these](https://github.com/hsanchez7934/hs-build-your-own-backend/blob/master/test/routes.spec.js#L93-L97) assertions a little fragile, because it's relying on that data existing at a particular index in the array.

* Instead of doing [these loops](https://github.com/hsanchez7934/hs-build-your-own-backend/blob/master/test/routes.spec.js#L120-L126) you could just check that a particular object exists in the array. Looping through is a little redundant, if you can verify that one of these objects exists in this format, it's a safe bet the rest of them exist as well.

* A 404 [here](https://github.com/hsanchez7934/hs-build-your-own-backend/blob/master/test/routes.spec.js#L157-L166) is a little inaccurate. It's not that the endpoint doesn't exist, it's just that there happens to be nothing that matches the filter criteria. You could still return a 200 here but just return an empty array rather than an error.

* Assuming [these](https://github.com/hsanchez7934/hs-build-your-own-backend/blob/master/test/routes.spec.js#L220-L251) are skipped because they're failing. Can't tell off the bat what the issue would be here.

* Missing lots of [catches](https://github.com/hsanchez7934/hs-build-your-own-backend/blob/master/test/routes.spec.js#L280-L322) here.


### JavaScript Style

**20 points**: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

* What if there was a [min but not a max?](https://github.com/hsanchez7934/hs-build-your-own-backend/blob/master/server.js#L86-L91) or a max but not a min? This conditional isn't handling all possible scenarios.

* I wouldn't use ternaries in places like [this](https://github.com/hsanchez7934/hs-build-your-own-backend/blob/master/server.js#L117-L121). They are harder to read. You should only use ternaries in the simplest of use cases. e.g. nothing more complex than `let foo = bar ? true : false`

* I'd like this message [here](https://github.com/hsanchez7934/hs-build-your-own-backend/blob/master/server.js#L49) to be a little more specific. It's not that they haven't provided authorization at all or that there's something wrong with the token, it's that they simply don't have the correct level of permissions for performing this action.

* Tell me exactly what brand name I passed through [here](https://github.com/hsanchez7934/hs-build-your-own-backend/blob/master/server.js#L109) rather than just saying it doesn't exist.

* Be consistent with your styling. You have everything on [one line here](https://github.com/hsanchez7934/hs-build-your-own-backend/blob/master/server.js#L138) but multiple lines [here](https://github.com/hsanchez7934/hs-build-your-own-backend/blob/master/server.js#L151-L153). It goes a long way for readability if you can just be consistent with your stylistic choices.

* [This](https://github.com/hsanchez7934/hs-build-your-own-backend/blob/master/server.js#L199-L204) kind of strays from the way you're checking for required parameters elsewhere and I'm not totally sure what you're doing here. A patch can pass through as many or as few parameters as it wants, nothing is technically "required" here. The error message is too vague for me to make sense of.

### Workflow

**15 points**: Developer(s) make many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of the application but sometimes contain irrelevant changesets and inconsistent commit messages. Developer(s) use git branches and pull requests when applicable to incorporate changes into the application, and are not pushing fresh changes directly to master. Pull requests may contain little or no code review. There may be slight instances where the developer(s) have committed source code that should be .gitignored. There may be some instances of “dead” or commented-out code and debugger statements like console.log that need to be cleaned up.

* [This](https://github.com/hsanchez7934/hs-build-your-own-backend/blob/master/.DS_Store) should be in your .gitignore file

* 23 commits is definitely not enough for a project of this scope and size. You should have at least over 100. You should be committing smaller changesets more frequently.

* Would be good to see some use of github issues for tracking what needs to be done

* You should squash any repetitive commits like 'Update README'

* [This](https://github.com/hsanchez7934/hs-build-your-own-backend/commit/0bdd22440852de809b7465b1ad087119cf4c4e71) isn't a very helpful commit message. Line 66 means nothing to me, and it won't be line 66 forever as you start editing your application.
