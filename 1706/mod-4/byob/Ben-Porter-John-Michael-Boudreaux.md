# Code Quality

#### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub that you are proud of
[happy code]()

We feel very good about our entire server.js file. With everything being a turnary as well as being dirct readable code we feel that it is all well done. 

#### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub that you feel not great about
[sad code]()

The code we feel could use a bit more love is the fron end side of things. While it fits all the requirements it is not the most clean user friendly front end code we have done. 

#### Attach a screenshot or paste the output from your terminal of the result of your test-suite running.

# Instructor Feedback (Brittany)

The following set of points are distributed at the discretion of the instructor.

### Documentation

**9 points**: The README includes documentation for all available endpoints and how to use them. Instructor can easily follow the documentation for using the API.

* Nice [intro paragraph](https://github.com/johnmboudreaux/BYOB#by-ben-porter-and-john-boudreaux)

* Good formatting, easy to read and follow along with

* Would like you to be just a littleeee more explicit about data types for your [POST and PATCH requests](https://github.com/johnmboudreaux/BYOB/blob/master/docs/POST_owners.md#request-body). I can infer based on the request body example, but it would be nice for you to explicitly tell me the data types as well.

### Feature Completion

**60 points**: Developer has implemented all 10 endpoints, 4 are secured via JWTs and one is a custom endpoint that filters data based on query params. The database is seeded with at least two tables and one relationship.

### Testing & Linting & Error Handling

**35 points**: Project has a running test suite that covers all happy and sad paths for the appropriate endpoints. Error handling is informative and helpful for the end-user. The project has a linting configuration that passes with no errors.

* Test file should just be named `routes.spec.js` not `routes.spec.test.js`

* Missing a [.catch()](https://github.com/johnmboudreaux/BYOB/blob/master/test/routes.spec.test.js#L31)

* Unless the linter was yelling at you for some reason, I'd use an implicit return in the [.catches](https://github.com/johnmboudreaux/BYOB/blob/master/test/routes.spec.test.js#L48-L51) here. Just to be consistent with the implicit return you're using in the `.then()`

* Nitpick but your it blocks should read like English. [This](https://github.com/johnmboudreaux/BYOB/blob/master/test/routes.spec.test.js#L55) one reads a little funny

* Nice specific [error message](https://github.com/johnmboudreaux/BYOB/blob/master/test/routes.spec.test.js#L130)

* Remember that there is no guarantee that your data will come back in a particular order. So writing [assertions like this](https://github.com/johnmboudreaux/BYOB/blob/master/test/routes.spec.test.js#L148-L156) can be a little fragile. I'd rather you just check that the array includes an object that matches those key/values with `.includes()`

* I'd add another assertion [here](https://github.com/johnmboudreaux/BYOB/blob/master/test/routes.spec.test.js#L173) that checks that the items in the array have a zip code that matches 87501

* Give me the zip code back [here](https://github.com/johnmboudreaux/BYOB/blob/master/test/routes.spec.test.js#L190) in the error message so that I can double-check that I didn't fat finger the zip code.

* [This](https://github.com/johnmboudreaux/BYOB/blob/master/test/routes.spec.test.js#L335) error message is a little vague for a user. I'd rewrite it to tell them that they don't have admin privileges to perform that action.


### JavaScript Style

**25 points**: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

* [This](https://github.com/johnmboudreaux/BYOB/blob/master/server.js#L47-L50)ternary is really difficult to read. As is [this](https://github.com/johnmboudreaux/BYOB/blob/master/server.js#L67-L71) one. And pretty much all the other ones that you're using. You should only use ternaries in the simplest of use cases. e.g. nothing more complex than `let foo = bar ? true : false` Otherwise use an if/else.

* In general, it'd be better to send the token through as an authorization header rather than in the [body](https://github.com/johnmboudreaux/BYOB/blob/master/test/routes.spec.test.js#L251). This prevents you from having to delete that property from the object before inserting it into the database.


### Workflow

**17 points**: Developer(s) make many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of the application but sometimes contain irrelevant changesets and inconsistent commit messages. Developer(s) use git branches and pull requests when applicable to incorporate changes into the application, and are not pushing fresh changes directly to master. Pull requests may contain little or no code review. There may be slight instances where the developer(s) have committed source code that should be .gitignored. There may be some instances of “dead” or commented-out code and debugger statements like console.log that need to be cleaned up.

* Would be good to see some use of github issues for tracking what needs to be done

* Formatting of commit messages is a littleeeee inconsistent in terms of capitalization/tense

* Generally you don't want to commit [generated source code](https://github.com/johnmboudreaux/BYOB/commit/ff7d10bbf407e4f29fa405e48a9b32aca8f89b9a#diff-fae01302d764057eca5e4bfaa4bfbaa4) like bundle files. This causes a lot of headaches and unecessary merge conflicts when collaborating with other developers. You leave code generation like this to the server (e.g. on heroku, you might use a build pack or add a command in your Procfile that tells the server to run a webpack build of your codebase and generate the bundle file on the fly.)
