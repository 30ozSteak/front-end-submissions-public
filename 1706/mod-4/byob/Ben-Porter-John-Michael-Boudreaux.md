# Code Quality

#### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub that you are proud of
[happy code]()

We feel very good about our entire server.js file. With everything being a turnary as well as being dirct readable code we feel that it is all well done. 

#### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub that you feel not great about
[sad code]()

The code we feel could use a bit more love is the fron end side of things. While it fits all the requirements it is not the most clean user friendly front end code we have done.

# Instructor Feedback (Brittany)

The following set of points are distributed at the discretion of the instructor.

### Documentation

**9 points**: The README includes documentation for all available endpoints and how to use them. Instructor can easily follow the documentation for using the API.

* Nice [intro paragraph](https://github.com/johnmboudreaux/BYOB#by-ben-porter-and-john-boudreaux)

* Good formatting, easy to read and follow along with

* Would like you to be just a littleeee more explicit about data types for your [POST and PATCH requests](https://github.com/johnmboudreaux/BYOB/blob/master/docs/POST_owners.md#request-body). I can infer based on the request body example, but it would be nice for you to explicitly tell me the data types as well.
