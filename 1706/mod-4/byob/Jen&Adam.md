# Code Quality

#### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub that you are proud of
[happy code](https://github.com/jenPlusPlus/build-your-own-backend/blob/master/server.js#L182-L195)

* Why were you proud of this piece of code?
Neither of us had written a patch before. It took some debugging, but we were excited to work it out! We really enjoyed writing all of the server.js file. We're pleased with the cleanliness of the code.

#### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub that you feel not great about
[sad code](https://github.com/jenPlusPlus/build-your-own-backend/blob/master/test/routes.spec.js#L535-L550) 
(and other skipped tests)

* Why do you feel not awesome about the code? What challenges did you face trying to write/refactor it?
We struggled with inconsistent output depending on where we tested our code (either automated or manually). We got 3 different results for some tests between running the tests locally, testing in Postman, and the tests running on CircleCI. The lack of a production database may be affecting the CircleCI build.

#### Attach a screenshot or paste the output from your terminal of the result of your test-suite running.

#### Please feel free to ask any other questions or make any other statements below!

Anything else you wanna say
We enjoyed writing the server and API. We paired for much of the code, and are proud of what we wrote. The tests were not particularly difficult to write, but we had issues depending on the environment where they ran.

# Instructor Feedback (Brittany)

The following set of points are distributed at the discretion of the instructor.

### Documentation

**9 points**: The README includes documentation for all available endpoints and how to use them. Instructor can easily follow the documentation for using the API.

* I like the waffle badge and the links to the project spec and heroku URL in the README.

* Nice organized tables with data types and required information. Very detailed. Would just like a littleeee more information on how to actually be authorized for a protected endpoint.
