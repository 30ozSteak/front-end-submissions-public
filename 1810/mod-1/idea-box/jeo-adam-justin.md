## Notes/What To Work On:

### Functional Expectations

*  Proficient - Applications adds 'Filtering by Importance' and 'Recent Ideas' as outlined in the spec
*  Exceptional - Application adds all of the extensions

### Comp Recreation

*  Proficient - Application implements all major comp details accurately and correctly on desktop and mobile (colors, fonts, icons,spacing, alignment,  etc.) with smooth transitions between screen sizes. Additional elements added generally match the visuals established in the comps, but may be slightly awkward

### HTML - Style and Implementation

*  Proficient - Applications adds to the above with markup that is easy to read and follow across naming conventions
  *  Implements html that is accessible for folks with visual disabilities.

### CSS - Style and Implementation

*  Proficient - Applications adds to the above by removing repetitive rules and blocks of code according to the DRY principle

### JAVASCRIPT - Style and Implementation

*  Exceptional - Application adds to code quality by refactoring all for loops into the proper array prototype iteration methods and:
  *  Using logical operators instead of if/else
  *  Application changes anonymous functions to arrow functions and changes all variables to be block scoped (`let` and `const`)
  *  Application stores all ideas in one array in local storage, instead of individually
  *  When 'Filtering and Searching by Text' and 'Filtering by Importance' All ideas that do not need to be shown on the dom should be completely removed from the dom, instead of only being hidden from view
