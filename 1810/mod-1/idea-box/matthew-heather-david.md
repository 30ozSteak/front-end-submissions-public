## Student: Matthew, Heather, David
## Evaluator: Louisa
## Notes/What To Work On:

- watch stylistic consistency within the codebase -- alternate between `rem` and `em` for font-size and using `0` vs `0px`
- HTML is generally well named and well structured, a couple of places that a more modular approach could be used to make classes more reusable
- JS has some areas that could use refactor
- `showMoreLessCards()` function uses an approach to hide/show cards beyond 10 that is very hacky and won't hold up to user testing (adds or removes a fixed height on the parent card container with no overflow) -- not a true solution for this functionality

### Functional Expectations

*  Advanced Beginner - Application adds 'Changing the quality of an idea' and enables 'Filtering and Searching by Text' as defined in the spec
*  Proficient - Applications adds 'Filtering by Importance' and 'Recent Ideas' as outlined in the spec

### Comp Recreation

*  Proficient - Application implements all major comp details accurately and correctly on desktop and mobile (colors, fonts, icons,spacing, alignment,  etc.) with smooth transitions between screen sizes. Additional elements added generally match the visuals established in the comps, but may be slightly awkward


### HTML - Style and Implementation

*  Advanced Beginner - Application adds to the above by using appropriate semantic elements and using `data-*` attributes for all data related things
*  Proficient - Applications adds to the above with markup that is easy to read and follow across naming conventions

### CSS - Style and Implementation

*  Proficient - Applications adds to the above by removing repetitive rules and blocks of code according to the DRY principle

### JAVASCRIPT - Style and Implementation

*  Advanced Beginner - Application adds to the above by correctly implementing a data model for the `Idea` class including all required methods
