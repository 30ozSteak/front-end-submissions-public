## Notes/What To Work On:

Make sure if something is data related to use the `data-*` attributes in js

#### HTML
* Good use of semantic elements
* Clean HTML stylistically

#### CSS
* Consider leveraging more relative units particularly for widths
* Consider using organizational comments and alphabetizing within rules so that
  you're able to find things more easily

#### JS
* You all seem to have a good understanding of what's going on in the codebase,
  which is great.
* DRY it up. Whenever there are 3 lines shared between functions, that should be
  its own function
* Be sure to use your debugging tools as you go. Line by line
