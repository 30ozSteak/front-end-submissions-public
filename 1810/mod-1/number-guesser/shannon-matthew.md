## Student: Shannon and Matt
## Evaluator: David Whitaker
## Notes/What To Work On:

* Great job! Really solid first project, loved that y'all added the time tracking functionality.

### HTML

* Use forms for inputs that are tied to buttons
* Utilize more block elements and have flex containers be more specific

### CSS

* Consider adding organizational comments
* Try using more broad class declarations in place of comma separated classes

### JS

* Always air on the side of being more verbose for naming conventions.
* Consider using parameters and arguments if you identify duplicate statements to dry things up.
* Think in terms of single responsibilty principle (SRP) - Try keeping functions to 10 lines or less and invoke other functions within functions more.

## Functional Expectations

* Proficient: Application meets some of the phase two extensions and demonstrates good execution and control of the UI.
* Exceptional: Application meets all of the phase two extensions and demonstrates exceptional execution, creativity, and control of the UI.
