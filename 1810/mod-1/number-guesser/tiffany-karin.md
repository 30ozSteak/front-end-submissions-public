## Notes/What To Work On:

* Great job! Really solid first project, loved that y'all added the time tracking functionality.

### HTML

* Nice work, maybe be more consistent with class order in that class declaration

### CSS

* Consider adding organizational comments
* Try using more broad class declarations in place of comma separated classes
* Consider using a naming methodology like css BEM

### JS

* Love that you're using a user class
* Keep things local unless they need to be global
* Consider using parameters and arguments if you identify duplicate statements to dry things up.
* Style looked great. Could consider writing the template literal as if its html
