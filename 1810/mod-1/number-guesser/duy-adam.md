## Student: Duy Thanh Vu & Adam Niedzwiecki
## Evaluator: Travis Rollins
## Notes/What To Work On:
* Create many more commits and many more branches.
  * Clearer descriptions for commits and branches.
* A few bugs with error handling
* Not responsive yet.  Work on responsiveness and mobile view
* Continue to focus on semantic HTML like header or main instead of divs/sections
* Careful of using too many nested divs
* Use a form when you have multiple inputs and buttons
* Try to reuse classes for elements that are styled the same
* Make sure to organize properties of classes alphabetically
* Create organization of styles for developer empathy
* Some good uses of grouping (continue to do so or reuse one class)
* Make sure you follow CSS styleguide
* Good organization of js using global variables, event listeners, and function delcarations
* Clean up console.logs before eval
* Give a button a default state of disabled in HTML instead of JS
* Some good use of keeping functions SRP (continue to work on this)
* I like how you made it dynamic and reused a function for submitAnswer
* Careful of using nested if/else statements
