## Notes/What To Work On:

### HTML

* Be sure to use forms for inputs and associated buttons

### CSS

* Consider adding organizational comments
* Try using more broad class declarations in place of comma separated classes
* Look for duplication as you build

### JS

* Write with good style on the fly
* Consider using parameters and arguments if you identify duplicate statements to dry things up.
