## Student: Tim and Gabe
## Evaluator: Louisa
## Notes/What To Work On:

- use forms in HTML
- err on the side of using classes over ids
- pull media queries to bottom of page rather than after each individual rule -- current structure would be hard to maintain
- refactor `winnerBox` function
- UI needs polish, broken on mobile/small screens
- make sure both partners have access and ability to push to the github repo, and if not get help to get the problem resolved
- do not slack code to each other

## Functional Expectations

* Novice: Application meets most of the expectations of phase one and execution of UI is somewhat unpolished.
* Advanced Beginner: Application meets all of the expectations of phase one and execution of UI is somewhat unpolished but shows attention to detail.
