## Notes/What To Work On:
* Continue to make more commits.  
  * Good descriptive commit messages though!
  * Make sure both sides are making commits.
  * Continue to make more branches each time you create a new feature.
* A few things where elements are spaced unevenly 
  * Some things misbehaving as screen gets smaller and in mobile view
  * Careful of using alerts for errors.  Incorporate it in UI like the other errors you did.  Cheers!
* Careful of using lots of divs and spans
  * Try using more semantic html like H1, p tags, forms, etc.
* Nice organization with styles and alphabetizing properties
  * Remember to use box-sizing: border-box to elements behave property and respect heights/widths
  * Also to clean up code, try grouping classes together or reusing classes
* Clean up commented out lines in Javascript (as well as console.logs)
  * Try not to break out global variables into so many sections
* Dry up code when you see repeated lines of code
  * Keep functions SRP (single responsibility)
  * Keep functions shorter (try and aim for 8 lines max)
* Also, think how you can call fuctions inside of functions more.
  * Instead of running all functions at the same time (checking range, checking if you need to increase range, checking if the answer is right, etc.), try and run them when they need to be run using if/else conditionals
* For your time, try rounding the numbers using Math.round or Math.floor


## Functional Expectations

* Proficient: Application meets some of the phase two extensions and demonstrates good execution and control of the UI.
