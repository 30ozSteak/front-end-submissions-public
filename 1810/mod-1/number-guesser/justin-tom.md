## Notes/What To Work On:
* Nice work with creating clearer commits 
  * Continue to work on creating more commits
  * Create more branches each time you're working on a new feature 
  * DON'T PUSH UP TO MASTER!
* Nice work pairing up and collaboration.  Playing off each other's strengths.
* Might give some notification that a new game has started after winning.
* Nice error handling and handling multiple user inputs.
* Continue to work on spacing both in desktop and mobile views
  * Buttons get a bit squished
  * Title could be down a bit and centered vertically
  * Center inputs in mobile view
* Might use reset.css or normalize.css for next project for cross browser compatibility
* Careful of using too many div tags (try using more semantic HTML)
  * Use p or button tags instead of divs
* Careful of using camelCase on classes
* I would stick with only forms, inputs, and buttons having IDs
* Continue to work on formatting of HTML and style things according to the styleguide.
* Continue to work on structure of styles and alphabetizing properties
* Be careful of using vh and stick more with pixels or percentages(practice squishing window vertically)
* Clean up commented out lines of code
* Make sure styles follow CSS styleguide (tabbed in correctly)
* When you start to use more classes, hopefully you won't need to use so many styles for ids.  Reuse classes when elements share multiple styles
* Continue to clear up commented out lines in Javascript
* Don't need the window.onload for the global variables and class
* Clear up console.logs as well
* Grab elements in variables instead of returning them in functions.
  * Grab value in event listeners.
* Be consistent using function declarations in event listeners
* To give HTML inputs a default disabled state, add it to the HTML instead of the Javascript
* Nice work with some functions having SRP focus
  * Continue to work on this
