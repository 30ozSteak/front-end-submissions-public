## Student: Sally and Whitney
## Evaluator: Louisa
## Notes/What To Work On:

- watch indentation and stylistic consistency in code (html, css, and js)
- HTML styling is very inconsistent
- keep HTML and CSS naming modular and reusable
- keep global variables to a minimum
- UI is not responsive
- UI needs a polish pass, watch spacing and small details

## Functional Expectations

* Novice: Application meets most of the expectations of phase one and execution of UI is somewhat unpolished.
* Advanced Beginner: Application meets all of the expectations of phase one and execution of UI is somewhat unpolished but shows attention to detail.
