## Student: Dylan and Kristen
## Evaluator: Louisa
## Notes/What To Work On:

- in a good place to refactor
- some buggy behavior needs to be fixed
- UI fine turning needs to happen
- responsiveness is in place, need to tighten up layout and make sure all UI elements are really well executed -- watch out for details
