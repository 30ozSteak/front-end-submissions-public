## Notes/What To Work On:
* Nice work with commits and getting better with commit messages.
  * Continue to work on branches and branch names.
* Really good attention to UI and UX 
  * Handled multiple situations with input and user error
* Very good mobile view
  * Some buttons and text git a but squished on some views (might add a little additional spacing)
  * Buttons get very long and thin on tablet view.  Might think of ways to make them a bit shorter with a fixed width and a bit taller at certain break points
* Nice animation for the winner and good use of the timer
* Might use normalize.css or reset.css file in beginning to normalize across browsers
* Nice work reusing classes.  
* Don't need action on form since you are using event.preventDefault()
* Use styles for bolding fonts instead of using strong if you are not trying to add extra emphasis on text
* Might create more of a hierarchy using h3 or h4 tags instead of multiple p tags
* Also I would try to stay away from nested divs.  Try to find ways to clean up HTML structure and use sections or articles instead
* Great work organizing styles and alphabetizing properties
* Great work organizing properties alphabetically
* I really like the select function so you don't have to write all the querySelectors.  Very creative
* When removing cards, using event.target to delete the element.  If you need to move up the DOM tree, try using parentNode.
* Checking to see if the text is BOOM before creating a new card seems like additional logic.
  * You have already done this logic when you checked if the answer is correct or not.
* Might find ways to organize functions by error handling, etc instead of alphabetically
