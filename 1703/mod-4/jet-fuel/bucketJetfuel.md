## Completion

#### Were you able to complete the base functionality?

If not, explain what is missing and why.
* Didn't get the sorting done. Short on time.
* URL validation. Short on time.
* Date display. Short on time.
* Testing using seeding. Short on time.

#### Which extensions, if any, did you complete?

# Code Quality

  * I'd be proud of my code if I felt like I was able to really put time and care into making something significant. As it is, all my code was written rushed and haphazard.

* Why do you feel not awesome about the code? What challenges did you face trying to write/refactor it?
* Time is the number one challenge. When you spend 3/7 days trying to remember how to write jQuery and another 2 days troubleshooting, you're left with 2 days of actual code writing.

#### Attach a screenshot or paste the output from your terminal of the result of your test-suite running.
