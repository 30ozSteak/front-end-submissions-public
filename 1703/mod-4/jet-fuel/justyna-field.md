# Jet Fuel Submission Form

[Project Spec](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/jet-fuel.html)

# Basics

#### Link to the Github Repository for the Project
[jetfuel](https://github.com/JustynaField/jet-fuel)

#### Link to the Deployed Application
[heroku](https://justyna-jet-fuel.herokuapp.com/)

#### Link to your annotated server file
[annotated server file](https://github.com/JustynaField/jet-fuel/blob/master/server-comments.js)

## Completion

#### Were you able to complete the base functionality?

I have all of the base functionality working, except for these two pieces:

- Visit a folder and sort the folder’s URLs by how recently they were added (both descending and ascending order)
- Enter a URL to be shortened only if it is a valid URL (impose some kind of URL validation)

I ran out of time, also, I found these last two things a little complex and time-consuming.

# Code Quality

#### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you are proud of
[server.js](https://github.com/JustynaField/jet-fuel/blob/master/server.js),
[test seeds](https://github.com/JustynaField/jet-fuel/blob/master/db/test/seeds/folders.js)

* Why were you proud of this piece of code?

It is the first time that I built back-end code and it makes me feel really good. 

#### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you feel not great about
* Why do you feel not awesome about the code? What challenges did you face trying to write/refactor it?

I do not feel awesome about not completing the sorting function. It was harder than I thought it would be. jQuery ''bubbling' made it difficult to create events on elements inside folders. 
I tried url validation by either using regex, or npm package, and could not make it to work.
Also, the heroku page does not represent the most up-to-date version of my app. I didn't know how to update my app on heroku.

#### Attach a screenshot or paste the output from your terminal of the result of your test-suite running.

# Instructor Feedback (Brittany)

## Specification Adherence

**20 points**: There are two features missing from the base expectations that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.

## User Interface

**18 points**: The application is pleasant, logical, and easy to use. There no holes in functionality and the application stands on it own to be used by the instructor without guidance from the developer.

* CSS transition is a little rigid when opening or closing a folder. I'd also like the cursor to turn into a 'hand' like a regular clickable link when I hover on one of the folders so that there's a more clear indication that I can click on this thing to expand or collapse it.

## Data Persistence with SQL Database

**18 points**: The application persists data in a SQL database but with correct relationships between folders and URLs, slight error with column fields re: uniqueness

* The [shortUrl](https://github.com/JustynaField/jet-fuel/blob/master/db/migrations/20170816132247_initial.js#L14) must be a unique value. If you generate two of the same short URLs, that point to different long URLs, one of them will be overridden. 
 
## Annotated Server File

**8 points**: Each line of the server file (on a separate branch) is commented and explains the code using mostly accurate terminology

* [Note also that it's falling back to running on port 3000, not that it is always running on 3000](https://github.com/JustynaField/jet-fuel/blob/master/server-comments.js#L21)
* [What does a POST request actually do? I'd like to know that you recognize that it creates a new resource](https://github.com/JustynaField/jet-fuel/blob/master/server-comments.js#L53-L54)
* I wouldn't call id a [placeholder](https://github.com/JustynaField/jet-fuel/blob/master/server-comments.js#L81) here, it represents a 'dynamic segment' of the URL


## Testing

**x points**: Lorem ipsum dolor set amet

## JavaScript Style

**x points**: Lorem ipsum dolor set amet

## Workflow

**13 points**: The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are some formatting issues in the code base, some commits would've been better on branches.

* Would like to see more use of feature branches rather than committing straight to master
* Another file you want to make sure to .gitignore is this [DS_Store](https://github.com/JustynaField/jet-fuel/blob/master/.DS_Store) file
* Nice, consistently formatted commit messages though I would recommend starting them all with a capital letter.  [This](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) is a good set of rules to follow for formatting your commit messages.
* [Some](https://github.com/JustynaField/jet-fuel/commit/ad4cf691ba18813148882b16de5c6edf04e5d860) commits would have been better on a branch rather than committed to master, especially when they contain commented-out code or are a work in progress.
