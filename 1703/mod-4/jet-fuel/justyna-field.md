## Completion

#### Were you able to complete the base functionality?

I feel that I have all of the basic functionality working, except for these two pieces:

- Visit a folder and sort the folderâ€™s URLs by how recently they were added (both descending and ascending order)
- Enter a URL to be shortened only if it is a valid URL (impose some kind of URL validation)

I ran out of time, also I found it a little complex and time-consuming.
