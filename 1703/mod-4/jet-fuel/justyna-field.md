[annotated server file](https://github.com/JustynaField/jet-fuel/blob/master/server-comments.js)

## Completion

#### Were you able to complete the base functionality?

I have all of the basic functionality working, except for these two pieces:

- Visit a folder and sort the folder’s URLs by how recently they were added (both descending and ascending order)
- Enter a URL to be shortened only if it is a valid URL (impose some kind of URL validation)

I ran out of time, also I found these two last things a little complex and time-consuming.

# Code Quality

#### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you are proud of
[server.js](https://github.com/JustynaField/jet-fuel/blob/master/server.js),
[test seeds](https://github.com/JustynaField/jet-fuel/blob/master/db/test/seeds/folders.js)

* Why were you proud of this piece of code?

It is the first time that I built back-end code and it makes me feel proud. 

#### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you feel not great about
* Why do you feel not awesome about the code? What challenges did you face trying to write/refactor it?

I do not feet awesome about not completing the sorting function. It was harder than I thought it would be. jQuery ''bubbling' made it hard to create events on elements inside folders. 
I tried url validation by either using regex, or npm package, and could not make it to work.
Also, the heroku page does not represent the most up-to-date version of my app. I didn't know how to update my app on heroku.
