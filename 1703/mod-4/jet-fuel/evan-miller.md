## Completion

#### Were you able to complete the base functionality?

No, I am missing the functionality of having each folder expand when clicked upon. Time was the limiting factor, due to a slow work pace and missing a night to code to focus on my Demo Night performance. All the other functionality is there. I'm happy with the result, but would of loved to implement that final piece.
 
#### Which extensions, if any, did you complete?

None.

# Code Quality

#### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you are proud of
[happy code](https://github.com/EvanSays/jetfuel/blob/master/public/main.js)

* Why were you proud of this piece of code?

Line 27: I like that added the check to see if all the input fields were not blank when a user submits their url. On Line 36, I found a way to grab the selection on a drop down. This was extremely useful for me to to compare and filter links later on.

#### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you feel not great about
[sad code](https://github.com/EvanSays/jetfuel/blob/master/public/styles.css)

* Why do you feel not awesome about the code? What challenges did you face trying to write/refactor it?

The CSS and HTML are a cluster mess imo. This was partly due to rushing through the project. If I had to refactor something on this project, I would jump to clean these up a bit.

#### Attach a screenshot or paste the output from your terminal of the result of your test-suite running.

Anything else you wanna say!

Overall, a fun project to practice using jQuery again. I also enjoyed going full circle with Heroku and CircleCI.
