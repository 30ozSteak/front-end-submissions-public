## Completion

#### Were you able to complete the base functionality?

Yes :)

#### Which extensions, if any, did you complete?

No extensions :(

# Code Quality

#### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you are proud of
[happy code](https://github.com/jdiejim/Jet-Fuel/blob/master/src/views/Collections.js#L1-L97)

* Why were you proud of this piece of code?

I tried to mimic the structure and workflow of React, and separated the views in different files. I was able to handle the views' functionality more easily, and putting it all together was easier.

#### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you feel not great about
[sad code](https://github.com/jdiejim/Jet-Fuel/blob/master/test/routes.spec.js#L17-L24)

* Why do you feel not awesome about the code? What challenges did you face trying to write/refactor it?

This works but it does not follow the template we saw in class. It took me a while to make it work. I was confused with the before, and after hooks, and decided to discard them, and instead use before each to rollback 2 migrations, run latest, and reseed for each test.

#### Attach a screenshot or paste the output from your terminal of the result of your test-suite running.

#### Please feel free to ask any other questions or make any other statements below!

I tried for fun using an MVC architecture, and created 2 models that handle the interaction with the database. 2 controllers that handled the requests and responses, and two views made with jQuery. It has a lot of files, but I found it easier to maintain and understand. I wanted to ask you if there are better ways of structuring node servers?

# Instructor Feedback (Brittany)

## Specification Adherence

**45 points**: No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use except the URL validation is a little buggy.

* URL validation is off or unrecognizable - I can't type in a URL that is www.nhl.com and have the short URL bring me to the NHL website. (It tries to bring me to https://jdj-jet-fuel.herokuapp.com/www.nhl.com instead)

## User Interface

**12 points**: The application shows a lot of effort in the interface, but there are a few things that make the interactions a bit confusing. The evaluator has some difficulty using the application when reviewing the features in the user stories.

* I like how you broke out the flow of the user interaction to let the user focus solely on creating a URL first, then assigning it to a folder, but the timing of when the folder selection shows up is a little bizarre. Instead of having it show up as soon as I key into the URL field, I would wait until the user has a valid URL in the input. 
* Top left logos usually link you back to the default/home page, I'd make this a link to the shorten page
* I'd expect to be able to click on a folder and have it show me the collections page and the URLs - it's also weird that the 'Save' buttons still exist on the list of folders even after I've saved my URL and the input boxes have been cleared out.
* The 'URL not valid' message sticks around long after I've entered a new valid url. 
* The overflow: scroll on all your containers is a little offputting, when there is no scroll it looks like you have very large white borders on the right and bottom of all your elements.
* It's difficult to tell that the sorting arrows are going to sort the URLs by date. I'd add a label to those or make them line up more closely with the dates in the URL list.
* There's some bizarre bug where I can click on the top border of the URL list and the urls will completely disappear. Clicking one of the sorting arrows makes them return.


## Data Persistence with SQL Database

**18 points**: The application persists data in a SQL database but with correct relationships between folders and URLs, slight error with column fields re: uniqueness

* The [shortUrl](https://github.com/jdiejim/Jet-Fuel/blob/master/db/migrations/20170815171324_paths.js#L10) must be a unique value. If you generate two of the same short URLs, that point to different long URLs, one of them will be overridden. 
 
**x points**: Lorem ipsum dolor set amet

## Testing

**x points**: Lorem ipsum dolor set amet

## JavaScript Style

**x points**: Lorem ipsum dolor set amet

## Workflow

**14 points**: The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are some formatting issues in the code base.

* ~40 commits likely isn't enough for the scope of this project. Commits like [this](https://github.com/jdiejim/Jet-Fuel/commit/1c44d676ca9b1a053b29c2d1191314af69b67efd) are doing way too much. Pull requesting a diff this large in a single commit would make it more difficult for teammates to do a code review on it.
* Good use of branches, though I'm not sure I would prefix their names with your initials. (You may have been told to do this by previous mentors/instructors). Just as an FYI I've never seen that convention in the real world. Multiple people can actually work on branches so it might not make sense all the time. I would stick to naming them in regards to what functionality they'll be adding.
* Nice, consistently formatted commit messages though I would recommend starting them all with a capital letter. [This](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) is a good set of rules to follow for formatting your commit messages.
