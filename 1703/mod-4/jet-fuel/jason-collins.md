## Completion

#### Were you able to complete the base functionality?
Yes, everything as I understand it in the base requirements is completed.

If not, explain what is missing and why.

#### Which extensions, if any, did you complete?
I did not complete any of the extensions.

# Code Quality

#### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you are proud of
[happy code](https://github.com/the-oem/jetfuel/blob/master/public/assets/js/script.js#L56)

* Why were you proud of this piece of code?
_~ I wasn't sure what the best way to approach inline sorting of DOM elements would be, so getting this to work in a fairly simple manner felt good. Same could be said for the folder sorting code, as well._

#### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you feel not great about
[sad code](https://github.com/the-oem/jetfuel/blob/master/public/assets/js/script.js#L195)

* Why do you feel not awesome about the code? What challenges did you face trying to write/refactor it?
_~ This is the code to toggle showing and hiding the list of links for a given folder. I did this using jQuery animate(), however I would like to have done something more slick using CSS and just use jQuery to add or remove appropriate classes to the DOM elements. It feels sluggish and choppy using the jQuery code. Sad Panda._

#### Attach a screenshot or paste the output from your terminal of the result of your test-suite running.

* Anything else you wanna say! ~ _It felt pretty good to have the CircleCI tests running with each PR, and seeing the subsequent deploys to Heroku automatically was very cool :)_
