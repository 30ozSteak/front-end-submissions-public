(Yes)

* Had at least 10 endpoints that returned responses with appropriate status codes?
(Yes)

* Secured at least 4 endpoints with JWTs?
(Yes)

(Yes)

* Wrote tests for both happy and sad paths for each endpoint?
(Yes)

(Yes)

# Code Quality

#### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you are proud of
[happy code](https://github.com/EvanSays/byob/blob/master/server/server.js#L60)

* Why were you proud of this piece of code?

We were happy to get the query params to work dynamically.

#### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you feel not great about
[sad code](https://github.com/EvanSays/byob/blob/master/db/seeds/dev/crisprseed.js)


* Why do you feel not awesome about the code? What challenges did you face trying to write/refactor it?

We've been having problems with pulling down eachothers code and changing the file name to our seed file. It could of been caused from us deleting it in the begining. Lesson learned.

#### Attach a screenshot or paste the output from your terminal of the result of your test-suite running.

# Instructor Feedback (Brittany)

The following set of points are distributed at the discretion of the instructor.

### Documentation

**8 points**: The README includes documentation for all available endpoints and how to use them. Instructor needs some clarification when following the documentation for using the API.

* Not sure if the hyphens [here](https://github.com/EvanSays/byob/blob/master/docs/GET_genes_id.md#parameters) indicated you were planning on adding additional information or not, but that's how it appears. It would be good to add the data type of all the params so I know when to pass through an integer vs string, etc. I'd also like to know exactly which parameters are required. "One or more" isn't super helpful.

### Feature Completion

**60 points**: Developer has implemented all 10 endpoints, 4 are secured via JWTs and one is a custom endpoint that filters data based on query params. The database is seeded with at least two tables and one relationship.

### Testing & Linting & Error Handling

**35 points**: Project has a running test suite that covers all happy and sad paths for the appropriate endpoints. Error handling is informative and helpful for the end-user. The project has a linting configuration that passes with no errors.

* Whomp whomp what's this [file](https://github.com/EvanSays/byob/blob/master/test/testData.js) doing?

* Where is your [.catch](https://github.com/EvanSays/byob/blob/master/test/genesServerTest.spec.js#L38-L42)? Also, while this code works, it's probably still better to break the `migrate.latest` out into a `before` block. Even though it essentially won't do anything assuming the database is up-to-date, it's still adding uncessary time to your test runner.

* You shouldn't have to do this [double request](https://github.com/EvanSays/byob/blob/master/test/genesServerTest.spec.js#L184-L189) to test endpoints that require authentication. Simply pass in a valid JWT that has been previously generated and won't expire (you'd set this as an environment variable in a .env file or something of the sort). Doing multiple requests in a single test is error prone and muddies the cause of errors.

* If you're going to break out your tests into multiple files, I'd also move all of these [authentication tests](https://github.com/EvanSays/byob/blob/master/test/journalsServerTest.spec.js#L23-L74) into their own file as they're not directly related to journals.

### JavaScript Style

**30 points**: Lorem ipsum dolor set amet

* This is weird ordering/spacing of your [dependencies](https://github.com/EvanSays/byob/blob/master/server/server.js#L5-L8). Common convention is to list all 3rd-party dependencies first with no line breaks, break once, include your own dependencies, break once, start the app setup.

* [Payload](https://github.com/EvanSays/byob/blob/master/server/server.js#L26) is always too generic and always a bad name for a variable. I know you often see it in documentation, but if you know what kind of data you're getting, you should name it as such.

* This [styling](https://github.com/EvanSays/byob/blob/master/server/server.js#L33-L35) makes it a little difficult to read. I would also refactor this to just toggle the value of an `admin` variable, and do a single `Object.assign` afterwards with that variable.

* I would bump [this](https://github.com/EvanSays/byob/blob/master/server/server.js#L60) endpoint handler down so that it's not sitting in between all the /journals endpoints. Keep any journal-related endpoints together and any gene-related endpoints together.

* When you start seeing [repeat code like this](https://github.com/EvanSays/byob/blob/master/server/server.js#L146-L152) you might want to break it out into a helper file for handling errors.

* [Whomp whomp what's this](https://github.com/EvanSays/byob/blob/master/server/routes.js)
