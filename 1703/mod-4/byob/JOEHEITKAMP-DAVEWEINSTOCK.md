# Code Quality

#### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you are proud of
[happy code](https://github.com/dstock48/byo-backend/blob/9479202b684225496c2f71458d1b07410ca725c9/db/test/seeds/byob_test_seeds.js#L5-L30)

* Why were you proud of this piece of code?

We spent a fair amount of time working through the nested Promise.all setup to seed three databases and made consistent progress the whole time.  It was a fun puzzle that challenged us without making us want to throw the towel in.

#### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you feel not great about
[sad code](https://github.com/dstock48/byo-backend/blob/47d3945d83bd8b13ca3ae8aabf8acafdd6fdacb5/web-scraping/ski-resort-scraper.js#L31-L268)

* Why do you feel not awesome about the code? What challenges did you face trying to write/refactor it?

The website that we scraped to acquire our data had _very_ poor HTML and did not make proper use of classes. In order to select specific elements on the page that we wanted, we had to write some not-so-great feeling JS to do so. I don't necessarily know that there was a better way to do this, I just wish the website would have used more classes on their page elements.

#### Attach a screenshot or paste the output from your terminal of the result of your test-suite running.
