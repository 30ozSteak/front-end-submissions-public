# Code Quality

#### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you are proud of
[happy code](https://github.com/buji405/byob/blob/master/src/router.js#L1-L22)

* Why were you proud of this piece of code?

This definitely helped us simplify our endpoints. By separating this piece of code we were able to create cleaner and more modular code. This allowed us to trace errors and update any functionality with greater ease.

#### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you feel not great about
[sad code](https://github.com/buji405/byob/blob/master/src/controllers/BreweriesController.js#L40-L67)

* Why do you feel not awesome about the code? What challenges did you face trying to write/refactor it?

Functionally this code works great, however, there is a lot of nexted promises and knex queries that could be separated into cleaner functionality. Also, although we split out our code into separate controllers, I feel there are even better ways we can separate our code to make everything single responsibility.

#### Attach a screenshot or paste the output from your terminal of the result of your test-suite running.

Great project - definitely taught us a ton about the complexities that go into an API, and we barely scratched the surface!
