# Code Quality

#### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you are proud of
[happy code](https://github.com/the-oem/byob/blob/master/utils/data/exifMiner.js)

* Why were you proud of this piece of code?
_We didn't have a ready-to-download set of data to populate out API with, so we had to go about writing code to
extract EXIF data from our own photos. In addition to that, we leveraged multiple JSON packages to turn
EXIF gps data into decimal lat/lon values to be populated in the locations data table. Fun stuff that we are proud of!_

#### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you feel not great about
[sad code](https://github.com/the-oem/byob/blob/master/src/Client/scripts.js)

* Why do you feel not awesome about the code? What challenges did you face trying to write/refactor it?
_The challenges we faced were time, with everything else going on. We would have liked to have spent
more time on this interface and the JS for it._

#### Attach a screenshot or paste the output from your terminal of the result of your test-suite running.

# Instructor Feedback (Brittany)

The following set of points are distributed at the discretion of the instructor.

### Documentation

**8 points**: The README includes documentation for all available endpoints and how to use them. Instructor needs some clarification when following the documentation for using the API.

* [This](https://github.com/the-oem/byob/blob/master/docs/POST_locations.md#parameters) is pretty vague. What are the params? What are their data types? I wouldn't know how to construct this object if it was the first page of documentation I landed on.

### Feature Completion

**x points**: Lorem ipsum dolor set amet

### Testing & Linting & Error Handling
