[BYOB](https://github.com/lindsaywparker/byob)

#### Link to the Deployed Application
[Heroku](https://lwp-byob.herokuapp.com/)


## Completion

#### Were you able to complete the base functionality?

* Documented all available endpoints and their usage in the README?
Yes

* Seeded a database with at least 2 tables and 1 relationship?
Yes

* Had at least 10 endpoints that returned responses with appropriate status codes?
Yes

* Secured at least 4 endpoints with JWTs?
Yes

* Enforced a linter and wrote code that conformed to it?
Yes

* Wrote tests for both happy and sad paths for each endpoint?
Yes

* Setup automatic deployments with CircleCI to a production app on Heroku?
Yes

# Code Quality

#### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you are proud of
[happy code](https://github.com/lindsaywparker/byob/blob/master/controller.jsL64-L82)

* Allows user to input an array of objects so long as they have name property in each index, and apply the changes to the applicable location, no need to get each id first. 

#### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you feel not great about
[sad code](https://github.com/lindsaywparker/byob/blob/master/controller.jsL36-L48)

* Ideally it shold allow posts to the state, city, and metro tables, rather than be limited to zip and neighborhood

#### Attach a screenshot or paste the output from your terminal of the result of your test-suite running.

# Instructor Feedback (Brittany)

The following set of points are distributed at the discretion of the instructor.

### Documentation

**9 points**: The README includes documentation for all available endpoints and how to use them. Instructor can easily follow the documentation for using the API.

* It would be good to add the data type of all the params so I know when to pass through an integer vs string, etc. You can do this directly alongside the name of the parameter in parens.

* I'd separate out the formatting of your required params vs. optional params so that they're in unique lists.

### Feature Completion

**x points**: Lorem ipsum dolor set amet

### Testing & Linting & Error Handling

**35 points**: Project has a running test suite that covers all happy and sad paths for the appropriate endpoints. Error handling is informative and helpful for the end-user. The project has a linting configuration that passes with no errors.

* [.catches!!](https://github.com/lindsaywparker/byob/blob/master/test/routes.spec.js#L17-L25)

* [This](https://github.com/lindsaywparker/byob/blob/master/test/routes.spec.js#L130-L146) kind of data I'd break out into it's own file and import it in. Usually you'll see a fixtures or mock directory that contains data like this for testing purposes.

* It's not vital to make secondary assertions like [this](https://github.com/lindsaywparker/byob/blob/master/test/routes.spec.js#L260-L266) after POST request. If you've asserted that the POST came back with a 201, you can generally assume that the length of the array has increased. Having multiple requests in a single test block muddies is error prone and muddies the true source of a bug. 

* This is also really nesty and [difficult to read](https://github.com/lindsaywparker/byob/blob/master/test/routes.spec.js#L581-L600). You should just make a single DELETE request based on an ID you know exists, and assert that a successful status code was returned. There are too many potential areas for error in this test that take away from testing DELETE functionality as a single unit.

### JavaScript Style
