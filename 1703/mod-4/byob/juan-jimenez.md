Yes

* Had at least 10 endpoints that returned responses with appropriate status codes?
Yes

* Secured at least 4 endpoints with JWTs?
Yes

* Enforced a linter and wrote code that conformed to it?
Yes

* Wrote tests for both happy and sad paths for each endpoint?
Yes

* Setup automatic deployments with CircleCI to a production app on Heroku?
Yes

# Code Quality

#### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you are proud of
[happy code](https://github.com/jdiejim/BYOB/blob/master/db/seeds/dev/data.js#L7-L36)

* Why were you proud of this piece of code?

I use recursion and promises to seed regions and industry in order. Before this I had problem with setting the id because the promises resolved at different times. With this code I was able to fix this bug.

#### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you feel not great about
[sad code](https://github.com/jdiejim/BYOB/blob/master/models/Betas.js#L114-L135)

* Why do you feel not awesome about the code? What challenges did you face trying to write/refactor it?

I was able to make this query work, but I was not sure if this is the correct way to do it. It checks what type of params the request has and respond base on different scenarios.

#### Attach a screenshot or paste the output from your terminal of the result of your test-suite running.
