# Instructor Evaluation Points: Sorting Suite
# Instructor: Limbo
# Comments:
* if you're gonna use es6, go all in!
* Could add test for empty and single-item array
* insertion could be made into one function
  * If you are going to break into separate functions, test both
* Great job walking through each sort!



#### 1. Fundamental JavaScript & Style

3: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

#### 2. Test-Driven Development

3.5: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality. Arrays of random numbers are generated to test the maximum number of elements which the algorithm can sort.

#### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

4: Application is expertly divided into logical components each with a clear, single responsibility

#### 4. Functional Expectations

3: Application meets all requirements as laid out per the specification.

#### 5. Code Sanitation

The output from ESLint showsâ€¦

4 - Zero complaints
