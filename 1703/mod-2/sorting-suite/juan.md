# Instructor Evaluation Points: Sorting Suite
# Instructor: Limbo
# Comments:
* quickSort is so pretty
* remove comments from code as a general rule of thumb (unless it's absolutely necessary to understand what the code is doing)
* testing: think about sad paths, would like a test for an empty array since you took time to write the logic in the function
* Overall GREAT project!!!

#### 1. Fundamental JavaScript & Style

4: Application has exceptionally well-factored code with little or no duplication and all components separated out into logical components. There are zero instances where an instructor would recommend taking a different approach.


#### 2. Test-Driven Development

4: Application is broken into components which are well tested in both isolation and integration. Arrays of random numbers and letters are generated to test the maximum number of elements which the algorithm can sort.

#### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

4: Application is expertly divided into logical components each with a clear, single responsibility


#### 4. Functional Expectations

4: Application meets all requirements, and implements one extension properly.

#### 5. Code Sanitation

The output from ESLint showsâ€¦

4 - Zero complaints
