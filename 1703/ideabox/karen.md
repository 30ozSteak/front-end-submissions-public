* __Advanced Beginner:__ Can modify arrays by adding or removing specific elements - uses array methods such as push or shift. Can use a for loop to iterate through array.
* __Proficient:__ Does not use for loops for arrays - uses array prototypes, such as forEach, to iterate through or manipulate arrays. Can use array to store more complicated data structures such as objects or nested arrays. Is comfortable/efficient with reading array prototype documentation and can efficiently test/apply array prototype methods they have not worked with before.
* __Exceptional:__ Uses variety array prototypes to iterate through arrays and manipulate/create new arrays without using documentation as a resource.

#### Objects & Prototypes

* __Novice:__ Can declare an object literal and define/articulate properties vs. methods for an object. Can extract values of an object's property, and assign new properties and/or reassign values of existing properties on an object.
* __Advanced Beginner:__ Can use object constructor functions and is comfortable with extracting values of properties on different object instances.
* __Proficient:__ Can use object prototypes. Can articulate the definition and the "why" of an object prototype - the best use cases for prototypes.
* __Exceptional:__ Can identify and apply best use cases for constructor functions vs object literals in their code, and leverages more advanced object prototype methods.

#### DOM Manipulation

* __Novice:__ Can articulate what the DOM is and can effectively target elements in vanilla JavaScript via class, id, or tag.
