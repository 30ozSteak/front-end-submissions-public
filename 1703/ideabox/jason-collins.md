## Evaluator: Robbie

## Optional Notes:

### Functional Expectations

* __Proficient:__ The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by jQuery. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals.

------------------------------------------------------------------

## HTML

#### Accessibility

* __Proficient:__ Employs detailed accessibility practices throughout markup, especially in forms and can speak to decisions made in accessibility choices as it relates to specific accessibility concerns.

#### Style

* __Proficient:__ Crafts lean, efficient markup that is easy to read and follow across naming conventions, structure, and solid formatting that follows industry best practices.

------------------------------------------------------------------

## CSS

#### Structure of Code

* __Proficient:__ Leverages cascading styles and CSS specificity rules to create more complex targeting of elements in order to reduce, reuse, share styles across elements. Organizes properties within rules based upon industry standard principles of writing consistent, idiomatic CSS.

#### Implementation

* __Proficient:__ Develops layouts that work cross-browser, are responsive, and can logically defend the choices made in implementation approach for layout.

------------------------------------------------------------------

## JAVASCRIPT

#### Data Types

* __Exceptional:__ Can assess and implement data type decisions for implementation based on increasing performance, shoring up code to be concise/clean, and composing for future maintainability.

#### Conditional Logic

* __Proficient:__ Can use an if/else statement to effectively handle multiple paths through the code. Writes if/else statements that only have one level of logic (no nesting). Can use logical operators instead of if/else statements where applicable.

#### Functions & Scope

* __Exceptional:__ Comfortable with using callback functions where applicable. Comfortable returning collections from functions (objects, arrays).

#### Arrays

* __Proficient:__ Does not use for loops for arrays - uses array prototypes, such as forEach, to iterate through or manipulate arrays. Can use array to store more complicated data structures such as objects or nested arrays. Is comfortable/efficient with reading array prototype documentation and can efficiently test/apply array prototype methods they have not worked with before.

#### Objects & Prototypes

* __Proficient:__ Can use object prototypes. Can articulate the definition and the "why" of an object prototype - the best use cases for prototypes.

#### DOM Manipulation

* __Exceptional:__ Understands the potential performance impact imposed by leveraging vanilla JavaScript vs. jQuery in their implementation and will make choices accordingly based on the problem to solve.

#### Style

* __Exceptional:__ Application demonstrates excellent knowledge of JavaScript syntax, style, and refactoring. Application has exceptionally well-factored code with little or no duplication.

------------------------------------------------------------------

## GIT & GITHUB

#### Git

* __Exceptional:__ Knows how to reset to previous commits, rebase large sets of small commits, if applicable, and other advanced Git maneuvers.

#### Github

* __Exceptional:__ Uses issues as resource for project management. There are comments on specific lines of pull requests with discussion about the implementation.

------------------------------------------------------------------

## DESIGN

#### Comp Recreation

* __Proficient:__ Developer captures the spirit and design intent of the comp. Some small details need polish to achieve a pixel-perfect match to the comp, but developer is clearly mindful of details and has made a conscious and careful effort to match the comp. Any design decisions left open to interpretation are handled thoughtfully and are well executed, but are more noticeable and/or unintuitive than they would be if the designer had provided the solution, or may not be totally seamless during screen-size transitions.
