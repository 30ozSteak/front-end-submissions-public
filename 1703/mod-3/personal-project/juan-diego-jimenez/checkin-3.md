#### Instructor Summary Checkin 1

- Have your backend set up
    - look into Node.js / express
    - Knex with PG && Bookshelf
    - look into testing (it's super easy I Promise.all)
    - have your tables set up
        - look into OAuth -> [auth0]('https://auth0.com/docs/quickstart/spa/react/01-login')
- Have your initial react, redux, router setup (boiler plate)

#### Instructor Summary Checkin 2

So I saw what you've completed and thats amazing! One thing that might help you in your quest is to make some seed data so that you can have a populated DB once everything is set up. Setting up your associations isn't going to be too difficult with Bookshelf.

TBH I don't think I have much to add to your PR. I think that if you focus on getting your tables set up correctly the moves in the front end will be pretty easy. Great job. Let me know if you run into any snags and we can üçê next week on some stuff!
