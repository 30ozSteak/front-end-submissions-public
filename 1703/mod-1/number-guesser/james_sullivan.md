## Evaluator: 
## Optional Notes: 

* Consider the human factor in the min/max range, might be worthwhile to add a confirmation note OR a "set" button. Something in the UI to reinforce that the inputs from user were accepted and the game is in play accordingly.
* Refactor the header and h1 - lose the extra div and the extra h1, can style words independently w/in a single h1 using spans
* Shore up the redundant clearfix class code

------------------------------------------------------------------

## HTML

#### Accessibility
 
* __Advanced Beginner:__ Leverages more precise semantic tags when applicable, and employs basic ARIA roles attributes for added clarity in structure, descriptive image alt attributes, title attributes for applicable anchor tags.  

#### Style

* __Advanced Beginner:__ Crafts markup with proper and logical nesting.  

------------------------------------------------------------------

## CSS

#### Structure of Code

* __Advanced Beginner:__ Can cleanly and logically organize CSS rules according to similar categories (i.e. typography, layout, components), and then logically organize the remaining CSS rules based on flow of the markup. Organizes properties within rules alphabetically.

#### Implementation

* __Advanced Beginner:__ Can articulate the differences between the approaches of absolute/relative positioning, flex-box, floats, and can appropriately apply the approaches to solve a variety of layout problems.

------------------------------------------------------------------

## JAVASCRIPT

#### Conditional Logic

* __Advanced Beginner:__ Uses if/else statements, but there are multiple levels of nesting, which makes the paths through the code difficult to follow. Understands what is "truthy" and "falsey" in JavaScript.

#### Functions & Scope

* __Advanced Beginner:__ Developer is comfortable using multiple arguments to pass data into functions. Understands how variables are scoped at the function level and global level. Functions are named descriptively. Knows when and why to use return in a function.

------------------------------------------------------------------

#### DOM Manipulation

* __Novice:__ Can articulate what the DOM is and can effectively target elements in vanilla JavaScript via class, id, or tag.

#### Style

* __Advanced Beginner:__ Code shows strong effort toward organization, but suffers from long functions, unnecessary or poorly named variables, and requires significant refactoring. Application may have some duplication and minor bugs. 

------------------------------------------------------------------

## DESIGN

#### Comp Recreation

* __Advanced Beginner:__ Can accomplish about 50-75% of the large and small design details and can logically rework them on at least 1 breakpoint.
