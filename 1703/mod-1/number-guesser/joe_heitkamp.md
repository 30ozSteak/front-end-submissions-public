## Evaluator: 
## Optional Notes: 

*  Refactor header to remove that extra markup (the div)
*  Potential refactor in button containers - maybe don't need them, or not both of them
*  Use percentages for box model props if you want relative units of measure. Save the em's for fonts and be sure to set a base font-size on your body
*  Consider refactor on the big if/else, research a switch statement in js

### Functional Expectations

* __Novice:__ Application meets all of the functional expectations in Phase One.
* __Advanced Beginner:__  Application meets all of the functional expectations in Phase Two.
* __Proficient:__ Application meets all of the functional expectations in Phase Three.
* __Exceptional__ You completed Phase Three and did something with Phase Four.

------------------------------------------------------------------

## HTML

#### Accessibility

* __Advanced Beginner:__ Leverages more precise semantic tags when applicable, and employs basic ARIA roles attributes for added clarity in structure, descriptive image alt attributes, title attributes for applicable anchor tags. 

#### Style

* __Advanced Beginner:__ Crafts markup with proper and logical nesting. 

------------------------------------------------------------------

## CSS

#### Structure of Code

* __Novice:__ Can effectively target DOM elements via tag, class, and/or id and write CSS rules around each element to create the desired style. 

#### Implementation

* __Novice:__ Can articulate how the CSS box model works and apply it appropriately in a static layout.

------------------------------------------------------------------

## JAVASCRIPT

#### Conditional Logic

* __Advanced Beginner:__ Uses if/else statements, but there are multiple levels of nesting, which makes the paths through the code difficult to follow. Understands what is "truthy" and "falsey" in JavaScript.

#### Functions & Scope

* __Advanced Beginner:__ Developer is comfortable using multiple arguments to pass data into functions. Understands how variables are scoped at the function level and global level. Functions are named descriptively. Knows when and why to use return in a function.

------------------------------------------------------------------

#### DOM Manipulation

* __Novice:__ Can articulate what the DOM is and can effectively target elements in vanilla JavaScript via class, id, or tag.

#### Style

* __Advanced Beginner:__ Code shows strong effort toward organization, but suffers from long functions, unnecessary or poorly named variables, and requires significant refactoring. Application may have some duplication and minor bugs. 

------------------------------------------------------------------

## DESIGN

#### Comp Recreation

* __Advanced Beginner:__ Can accomplish about 50-75% of the large and small design details and can logically rework them on at least 1 breakpoint.
