## Evaluator: Louisa
## Optional Notes:

Great attention to detail! Very nicely done, a few spots to polish and refine but overall well executed and demonstrated a high level of understanding of all her code and could speak to all of it.

### Functional Expectations

* __Proficient:__ Application meets all of the functional expectations in Phase Three.

------------------------------------------------------------------

## HTML

#### Accessibility

* __Novice:__ Knows what a semantic tag is and leverages the HTML5 structural tags to organize the content of their markup.

#### Style

* __Advanced Beginner:__ Crafts markup with proper and logical nesting.

------------------------------------------------------------------

## CSS

#### Structure of Code

* __Advanced Beginner:__ Can cleanly and logically organize CSS rules according to similar categories (i.e. typography, layout, components), and then logically organize the remaining CSS rules based on flow of the markup. Organizes properties within rules alphabetically.

#### Implementation

* __Proficient:__ Develops layouts that work cross-browser, are responsive, and can logically defend the choices made in implementation approach for layout.

------------------------------------------------------------------

## JAVASCRIPT

#### Conditional Logic

* __Proficient:__ Can use an if/esle statement to effectively handle multiple paths through the code. Writes if/else statements that only have one level of logic (no nesting). Can use logical operators instead of if/else statements where applicable.

#### Functions & Scope

* __Proficient:__ Functions have single responsibility. The entirety of the function is easy to read what functionality it contains. Function is generally shorter than 8 lines. Uses functions to eliminate repeated code. Comfortable refactoring any piece of code and extracting it to a function.

------------------------------------------------------------------

#### DOM Manipulation

* __Proficient:__ Able to extract information, modify attributes, or append/prepend data in the DOM easily regardless of whether they are employing vanilla JavaScript or jQuery. Understands how to harness event bubbling.

#### Style

* __Advanced Beginner:__ Code shows strong effort toward organization, but suffers from long functions, unnecessary or poorly named variables, and requires significant refactoring. Application may have some duplication and minor bugs.

------------------------------------------------------------------

## DESIGN

#### Comp Recreation

* __Proficient:__ Developer captures the spirit and design intent of the comp. Some small details need polish to achieve a pixel-perfect match to the comp, but developer is clearly mindful of details and has made a conscious and careful effort to match the comp. Any design decisions left open to interpretation are handled thoughtfully and are well executed, but are more noticable and/or unintuative than they would be if the designer had provided the solution, or may not be totally seamless during screen-size transitions.
