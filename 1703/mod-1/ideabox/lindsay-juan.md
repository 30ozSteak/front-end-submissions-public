## HTML

#### Accessibility

* __Proficient:__ Employs detailed accessibility practices throughout markup, especially in forms and can speak to decisions made in accessibility choices as it relates to specific accessibility concerns.

#### Style

* __Exceptional:__ Crafts lean, efficient markup and can speak directly to choices made to improve performance, including but not limited to, page load times, css/js optimizations, image optimizations.

------------------------------------------------------------------

## CSS

#### Structure of Code

* __Proficient:__ Leverages cascading styles and CSS specificity rules to create more complex targeting of elements in order to reduce, reuse, share styles across elements. Organizes properties within rules based upon industry standard principles of writing consistent, idiomatic CSS.

#### Implementation

* __Exceptional:__ Can articulate rationale for all parts of the CSS implementation (each line of code/CSS rule) specifically in regards to the balance of: structure of code, design integrity, performance.

------------------------------------------------------------------

## JAVASCRIPT

#### Data Types

* __Exceptional:__ Can assess and implement data type decisions for implementation based on increasing performance, shoring up code to be concise/clean, and composing for future maintainability.

#### Conditional Logic

* __Exceptional:__ Can write conditional logic that is succinct and easy to read. Logic can handle all situations where user gives incorrect/unexpected input.

#### Functions & Scope

* __Exceptional:__ Comfortable with using callback functions where applicable. Comfortable returning collections from functions (objects, arrays).

#### Arrays

* __Exceptional:__ Uses variety array prototypes to iterate through arrays and manipulate/create new arrays without using documentation as a resource.

#### Objects & Prototypes

* __Exceptional:__ Can identify and apply best use cases for constructor functions vs object literals in their code, and leverages more advanced object prototype methods.

#### DOM Manipulation

* __Exceptional:__ Understands the potential performance impact imposed by leveraging vanilla JavaScript vs. jQuery in their implementation and will make choices accordingly based on the problem to solve.

#### Style

* __Exceptional:__ Application demonstrates excellent knowledge of JavaScript syntax, style, and refactoring. Application has exceptionally well-factored code with little or no duplication.

------------------------------------------------------------------

## GIT & GITHUB

#### Git

* __Exceptional:__ Knows how to reset to previous commits, rebase large sets of small commits, if applicable, and other advanced Git maneuvers.

#### Github

* __Exceptional:__ Uses issues as resource for project management. There are comments on specific lines of pull requests with discussion about the implementation.

------------------------------------------------------------------

## DESIGN

#### Comp Recreation

* __Exceptional:__ Developer skillfully captures the spirit and design intent of all comp details. Execution is pixel-perfect and any design decisions left open to interpretation are solved intentionally, are as seamless as if the designer had provided the solution, are handled gracefully, and enhance the overall design.
