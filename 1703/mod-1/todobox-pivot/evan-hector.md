## HTML

#### Accessibility

* __Proficient:__ Employs detailed accessibility practices throughout markup, especially in forms and can speak to decisions made in accessibility choices as it relates to specific accessibility concerns.

#### Style

* __Proficient:__ Crafts lean, efficient markup that is easy to read and follow across naming conventions, structure, and solid formatting that follows industry best practices.

------------------------------------------------------------------

## CSS

#### Structure of Code

* __Advanced Beginner:__ Can cleanly and logically organize CSS rules according to similar categories (i.e. typography, layout, components), and then logically organize the remaining CSS rules based on flow of the markup. Organizes properties within rules alphabetically.

#### Implementation

* __Proficient:__ Develops layouts that work cross-browser, are responsive, and can logically defend the choices made in implementation approach for layout.

------------------------------------------------------------------

## JAVASCRIPT

#### Data Types

* __Exceptional__ Can assess and implement data type decisions for implementation based on increasing performance, shoring up code to be concise/clean, and composing for future maintainability.

#### Conditional Logic

* __Exceptional__ Can write conditional logic that is succinct and easy to read. Logic can handle all situations where user gives incorrect/unexpected input.

#### Functions & Scope

* __Exceptional__ Comfortable with using callback functions where applicable. Comfortable returning collections from functions (objects, arrays).

#### Arrays

* __Proficient__ Does not use for loops for arrays - uses array prototypes, such as forEach, to iterate through or manipulate arrays. Can use array to store more complicated data structures such as objects or nested arrays. Is comfortable/efficient with reading array prototype documentation and can efficiently test/apply array prototype methods they have not worked with before

#### DOM Manipulation

* __Proficient:__ Able to extract information, modify attributes, or append/prepend data in the DOM easily regardless of whether they are employing vanilla JavaScript or jQuery. Understands how to harness event bubbling.

#### Style

* __Proficient:__ Code is logically organized, such that reader can easily follow the progression of the app because variable and function names are descriptive and follow a single responsibility approach. There are no major bugs and minimal duplication.

------------------------------------------------------------------

## GIT & GITHUB

#### Git

* __Proficient__ Commits changes frequently with detailed commit messages. Uses feature branches to keep master branch free of incomplete features or bugs.

#### Github

* __Proficient__ Is comfortable with resolving merge conflicts. Asks for review/merge of their pull requests from teammates. Is comfortable editing code based on review feedback from a pull request and resubmitting the branch code.
