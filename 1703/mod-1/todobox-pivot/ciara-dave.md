## JAVASCRIPT

#### Data Types

* __Exceptional__ Can assess and implement data type decisions for implementation based on increasing performance, shoring up code to be concise/clean, and composing for future maintainability.

#### Conditional Logic

#### Functions & Scope

* __Exceptional__ Comfortable with using callback functions where applicable. Comfortable returning collections from functions (objects, arrays).

* __Exceptional__ Uses variety array prototypes to iterate through arrays and manipulate/create new arrays without using documentation as a resource.

#### DOM Manipulation

* __Exceptional__ Understands the potential performance impact imposed by leveraging vanilla JavaScript vs. jQuery in their implementation and will make choices accordingly based on the problem to solve.

#### Style

* __Proficient:__ Code is logically organized, such that reader can easily follow the progression of the app because variable and function names are descriptive and follow a single responsibility approach. There are no major bugs and minimal duplication.

## GIT & GITHUB

#### Git

* __Proficient__ Commits changes frequently with detailed commit messages. Uses feature branches to keep master branch free of incomplete features or bugs.

#### Github

* __Exceptional__ Uses issues as resource for project management. There are comments on specific lines of pull requests with discussion about the implementation.
