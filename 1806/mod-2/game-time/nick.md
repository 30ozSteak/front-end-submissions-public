### Functional Expectations

* 4 - Application is fully playable and exceeds the expectations set by instructors

* GH-pages deploy


### User Interface

* 3 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality.

### Testing


* 2.5 - Project has a running test suite that tests multiple levels but fails to cover some features. Some functionality is missing tests, or tests are asserting the wrong things.

* Testing is still pretty weak; make that a focus for your upcoming projects

### JavaScript Style & OOP

* 3 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing. Application is organized into classes (and correctly uses inheritance) with some misplaced logic and no major bugs. Business-logic code is mostly separated from view-related code. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what each line of code is doing.


### Workflow

* 4 - The developer/team effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application with descriptive commit messages. The team displays good pairing practices (driver-navigator, dividing up work, etc) and utilizes some sort of planning tool (GitHub issues, Waffle, Trello, etc). The team develops a clear MVP (minimum viable product) and conducts a DTR (define the relationship). Both members contribute meaningfully to the application.
