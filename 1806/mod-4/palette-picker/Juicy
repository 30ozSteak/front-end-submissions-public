## Completion

#### Were you able to complete the base functionality?

There are a few gaps. One of the most noticeable missing features is the ability to display the colors of saved projects in the projects modal. 
While I don't feel like this would be overly difficult to finish, there were just too many other gaps that needed filling before I felt confident enough in
the app itself.

It looks super rad.

# Code Quality

#### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub that you are proud of
[happy code](https://github.com/30ozSteak/Juicy/blob/ee312dbe4d41632ad0fd7a397a6a7bcf61be3a87/public/scripts/scripts.js#L128)
while this is iteration 0 of the project, I was pretty proud I made a very simple random color generator function. I've written one previously
before I came to turing that was much more complex and didn't make much sense. This one is much nicer and cleaner.

* Why were you proud of this piece of code?

#### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub that you feel not great about
[sad code]()
I'm sad it's not deployed to heroku properly! I'll have to figure out where in my get requests this is breaking. That's the sad part :(

* Why do you feel not awesome about the code? What challenges did you face trying to write/refactor it?

It not working is a pretty big reason to not feel awesome about it. I'll need to figure out why over the next few days when I refactor/clean everything up.

#### Link to Design Inspiration

* Show us what you used as design inspiration (another color picker site, a dribbble UI element, a user flow, etc.) and explain what you stole from it

After I (basically) made ideabox with colors, I saw this 'coin' login screen and wanted to Juicy in a similar way. so I did. There were a few other ideas that didn't get flushed out, but probably could with relative ease eventually.
