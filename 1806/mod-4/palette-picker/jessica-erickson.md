#### Link to Design Inspiration

I used the famous painting [Composition with Red Blue and Yellow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Piet_Mondriaan,_1930_-_Mondrian_Composition_II_in_Red,_Blue,_and_Yellow.jpg) as my primary inspiration, using all five colors for the initial state of my webpage, and using the blocky motif. I also used color contrast box structure idea from the book 'Itten; The Elements of Color' to make it easier to see what colors would work well together on-screen.
