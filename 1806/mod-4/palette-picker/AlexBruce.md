## Completion

#### Were you able to complete the base functionality?

I was unable to complete the base functionality of the project. I spent a lot of my time working on things for my job hunt, like making drafts of a cover letter, researching jobs, and actually applying. I also got sick during the weekend, which hampered my productivity for Palette Picker

# Code Quality

#### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub that you are proud of
[happy code](https://github.com/Alexbruce1/Palette-Picker/blob/master/server.js)

* Why were you proud of this piece of code?
Before beginning to add the database, I had some color palettes stored in my server file. While this wasn't the correct way to store data, I was happy to be able to have a server correctly communicating with my scripts file to display palettes on the page.

#### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub that you feel not great about
[sad code](https://github.com/Alexbruce1/Palette-Picker/tree/master/db)

* Why do you feel not awesome about the code? What challenges did you face trying to write/refactor it?
I was originally very excited to get a full stack project up and running, which is why I was sad to not be able to get the database effectively running.

#### Link to Design Inspiration

* Show us what you used as design inspiration (another color picker site, a dribbble UI element, a user flow, etc.) and explain what you stole from it
[Coolors](https://coolors.co/app)
Like most people in the class, I took some inspiration from this website because of its minimalistic look. For the rest of the project, it was stylistically just an evolution of what I've been learning in terms of good UI/design techniques. I've been trying to focus a lot on visual aspects of websites to grow my abilities of design.
