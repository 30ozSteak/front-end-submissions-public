## Completion

#### Were you able to complete the base functionality?
not quite

If not, explain what is missing and why.
-Folder names must be unique (you should not be able to create two folders with the same name)
-The saved palette should appear in the folder with the name of the palette (specified by the user) and the saved palette colors
-When you click on the name or colors in the saved palette, the palette generator should show the colors of that saved palette
-The saved palette should persist in your backend database
-Delete a palette from a project folder, which removes it from the page and database

^ these things are not working because on the last day of this project, my post stopped working for the palettes. I spent a long time trying to figure out why and never got it. :(

#### Which extensions, if any, did you complete? None

# Code Quality

#### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub that you are proud of
[happy code](https://github.com/caseyhoepner/palette-picker/commit/f684e81b7e1ec03400968a80a2eb118ade283bdb)

* Why were you proud of this piece of code? This was at one time all one function and I broke it out into multiple so it'd be more readable (and easier to test if I had been testing).

#### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub that you feel not great about
[sad code](https://github.com/caseyhoepner/palette-picker/commit/9a021086f2c16c22ca9f75b6114247de4838a1eb)

* Why do you feel not awesome about the code? What challenges did you face trying to write/refactor it? It was working then it wasn't working and try as I might, I couldn't figure out why

#### Link to Design Inspiration
[design inspo](https://coolors.co/5bba6f-3fa34d-2a9134-137547-054a29)

* Show us what you used as design inspiration (another color picker site, a dribbble UI element, a user flow, etc.) and explain what you stole from it. I stole the 'press spacebar to generate a new palette' functionality.

#### Please feel free to ask any other questions or make any other statements below!
