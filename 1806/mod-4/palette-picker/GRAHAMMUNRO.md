#### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub that you are proud of
[happy code](https://github.com/gmasterofnone/palettepop/blob/master/server.js)

I was able to combine project and palette tables to give a clean and ready-to-deploy array for the client-side.

#### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub that you feel not great about
[sad code](https://github.com/gmasterofnone/palettepop/blob/master/public/js/index.js)

I tried to do a OOD but just ran out of time.  Looking forward to refactor.

#### Link to Design Inspiration

* I borrowed the overall clean look from this site and just changed the full-width color orientation to horizontal instead of vertical because it lends itself better to a mobile-first design.
