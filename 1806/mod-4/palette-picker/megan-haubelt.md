## Completion

#### Were you able to complete the base functionality?

If not, explain what is missing and why.
I have a lot of the functionality with a few bugs. I spent a lot of time on it but introduced new bugs before completing this.  I had a really difficult time appending palettes to the correct project.  I left my commented out code as I tried to append to the id of the palette but it didn't work.

[happy code](https://github.com/Haub/palette-picker/blob/master/server.js) - 

* Why were you proud of this piece of code?
I got the backend to work.  I was proud of this since this was all introduced this week.


#### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub that you feel not great about
[sad code](https://github.com/Haub/palette-picker/blob/master/public/js/scripts.js) - Lines 110-126


* Why do you feel not awesome about the code? What challenges did you face trying to write/refactor it?  
This was the problem I talked about earlier.  It was really frustrating to not figure this out, especially all the time I spent doing it.
#### Link to Design Inspiration

* Show us what you used as design inspiration (another color picker site, a dribbble UI element, a user flow, etc.) and explain what you stole from it (http://paletton.com/) I liked the darker background color from this site.

#### Please feel free to ask any other questions or make any other statements below!

Anything else you wanna say!

I got caught up trying to get the code to work correctly and missed some of the other parts of the project.
