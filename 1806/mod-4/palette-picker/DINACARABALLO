## Completion

#### Were you able to complete the base functionality?

If not, explain what is missing and why.

# Code Quality

#### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub that you are proud of
[happy code](https://github.com/djcaraballo/PalettePicker/blob/master/server.js)

* Why were you proud of this piece of code?
I'm proud of this code because I have never set up a functional database before and it all worked!

#### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub that you feel not great about
[sad code](https://github.com/djcaraballo/PalettePicker/blob/master/public/index.js)

* Why do you feel not awesome about the code? What challenges did you face trying to write/refactor it?
This file is not awesome because I still have LOTS of refactoring to do. I also don't like the organization of it. The biggest challenge came from not working in vanilla JS for a while.

#### Link to Design Inspiration

* Show us what you used as design inspiration (another color picker site, a dribbble UI element, a user flow, etc.) and explain what you stole from it
I used coolors for inspiration, though my site looks quite different. What I liked most about this site is that you can see the interactions between the colors because they are touching.
