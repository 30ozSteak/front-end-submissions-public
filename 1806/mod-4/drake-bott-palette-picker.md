# Code Quality

#### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub that you are proud of
[happy code](https://github.com/bottd/palette-picker/blob/dfc4d5579d80c5a913f09d4ab9548a03097c44f9/server.js#L54)

* Why were you proud of this piece of code?

Got the project deletion to work and clear out associated palettes when a project is deleted.

#### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub that you feel not great about
[sad code](https://github.com/bottd/palette-picker/blob/dfc4d5579d80c5a913f09d4ab9548a03097c44f9/public/script.js#L158)

* Why do you feel not awesome about the code? What challenges did you face trying to write/refactor it?

I wanted it to submit to update the project name when you hit enter or deselected the input field, instead it was firing on each keypress which feels wrong to send that many requests.  It works though.


#### Link to Design Inspiration

* Show us what you used as design inspiration (another color picker site, a dribbble UI element, a user flow, etc.) and explain what you stole from it

I liked [this header](https://www.figma.com/file/H45c1UC58WGBddK0WHLiuDXl/Palette?node-id=0%3A1) from dribbble on my figma.
