## Notes/What To Work On:

* Nice job on commits and commit messages
* Keep on working on creating more branches each time you're working on a new feature/bug
* Great job on UI
* Try avoid using alerts in your next project when something should be disabled
* Careful of spacing with mobile view
* Good structure on HTML and use of ARIA
* Good structure of CSS and clean code
* Incorporate more grouping of CSS classes/etc.
* Good structure of breaking out javascript from global variables, event listeners, and then function declarations
* Really clean and refactored code.
* Can continue to keep breaking out functions into smaller functions but in general, very good.
* Experiment more using && or || operators especially when dealing with true/false inputs
