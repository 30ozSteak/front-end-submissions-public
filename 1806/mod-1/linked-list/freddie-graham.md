## Student: Freddie Levenson & Graham Munro
## Evaluator: Travis Rollins
## Notes/What To Work On:

* More detailed commits
* More branches when adding new features or working on bugs
* Super clean UI
* Maybe add more messages for UX if it isn't a valid url/etc.
* Try adding aria roles/labels to inputs/buttons
* Careful of using too many divs.  Try using more semantic html
* Good organization of CSS
* Experiment using percentages of height/width and pixels for padding/margin for honing in styling
* Good job of consistency of breaking out functions from event listeners
* Display none instead of hiding in javascript
* Remember if/else statements evaluate on true/false.  If a function is already returning true there doesn't need to be a `===` check
* Fantastic job of breaking out functionality
