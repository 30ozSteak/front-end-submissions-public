## Student: Drake Bott

## Notes/What To Work On:

* Keep in mind UX (user experience)
    - Add save button for min/max
    - Being able to use reset button without having to make a guess
* Adding aria labels for inputs and buttons
* Small refactor: use of multiple spans in title instead of using cascading styles
* Cleaning up styles and removing repeated lines
* Add some spacing for CSS and javascript for readability
* Careful of nested if/else statements
* Use function declarations for event listeners that have the same functionality to remove repeated code
