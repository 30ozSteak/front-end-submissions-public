## Notes/What To Work On:

* Careful of nested divs for a button
* Next step: add some aria labels
* Nice organization of styles as well
* Make sure not to use text-align on sections :)
* Add event as a parameter for your event listener functions
* Try to avoid alerts in the future and bring them into your UI
* Good organization of your javascript
    - Keep consistency in either anonymous functions or function delcarations for your event listeners
