## Notes/What To Work On:

- Nice job following spec; make sure that when you add things in (range inputs), they provide a good UI
- I love that you were tackling iteration 4 - I think you are super closeðŸ’ª
- Like we talked about, I'd recommend planning out your design before coding - draw your wireframes, label variables, event listeners, functions, etc. so you have a clear vision of the flow of entire app. I think this will help with those couple of spots where you were calling functions in places you didn't want/need to be.
