## Student: Kevin Simpson
## Evaluator: Travis Rollins
## Notes/What To Work On:

* Careful of spacing and margins especially for big monitors
* Great UX (user experience)
* Maybe add a message if they are putting a number outside of min/max
* Well-named classes
* Next step: Adding aria-labels 
* Cascading styles specifically with spans
* Great attention to detail in styles
* Organized styles and great grouping of classes
    - Still room for more grouping
    - Experiment with em/rem for fonts
* Consistency in event listeners using either function declarations or anonymous functions
* Breaking functions out into smaller functions especially where you see things doing the same thing

## Functional Expectations

* Exceptional: Application meets all of the expectations of phase three and one or more of the extensions.
