## Notes/What To Work On:

* Fantastic user experience
* Little more spacing between header and input
* Small differences in between spec and your user interface
* Clean and organized html
* Cheers to the use of aria "name" 
* Keep organization of elements, classes, ids, etc.
* Grouping elements together that share similar rules
* Don't put text-align on all elements :)
* Clean and organized javascript
* Setting default disabled in HTML
* Be careful of going after the same input and having to rename it multiple times depending on logic
    - See if there is something with the order of the javascript so that you only have one variable to your input instead of selecting it multiple times.
