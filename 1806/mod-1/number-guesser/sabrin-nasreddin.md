## Notes/What To Work On:

- code is a little messy: watch indentation and nesting
- remember that HTML structure and nesting is the foundation of everything you're building, so work to really lock in solid HTML before you start adding CSS and JS
- watch for unused properties in your CSS
- watch for long functions and think about places to refactor
