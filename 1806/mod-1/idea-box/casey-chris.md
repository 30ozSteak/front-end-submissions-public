## Student: Casey and Chris
## Evaluator: Louisa
## Notes/What To Work On:

- really well executed UI. a couple spots that could be polished for even better user experience, but they're minor details. Very tight execution and great attention to details.
- one buggy layout issue on iphone 5
- really clean HTML and css
- no global variables
- try out array prototypes instead of `for` loops!
- in a great spot to refactor -- see if you can reduce duplication in your code
- really solid project, super consistent quality level and attention to detail
- GOOD JOB!

## Functional Expectations

* Proficient  The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by jQuery. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals.


## HTML

## Accessibility

* Proficient  Employs detailed accessibility practices throughout markup, especially in forms and can speak to decisions made in accessibility choices as it relates to specific accessibility concerns.

## Style

* Exceptional Crafts lean, efficient markup and can speak directly to choices made to improve performance, including but not limited to, page load times, css/js optimizations, image optimizations.


## CSS

## Structure of Code


* Proficient  Leverages cascading styles and CSS specificity rules to create more complex targeting of elements in order to reduce, reuse, share styles across elements. Organizes properties within rules based upon industry standard principles of writing consistent, idiomatic CSS.


## Implementation

* Exceptional Can articulate rationale for all parts of the CSS implementation (each line of code/CSS rule) specifically in regards to the balance of: structure of code, design integrity, performance.


## JAVASCRIPT

## Data Types

* Proficient  Can identify and track data types through any variety of functions, understanding their affect and result on each line of code. Knows which scenarios are better suited for objects vs. arrays and employs them accordingly.

## Conditional Logic

* Proficient  Can use an if/esle statement to effectively handle multiple paths through the code. Writes if/else statements that only have one level of logic (no nesting). Can use logical operators instead of if/else statements where applicable.
* Exceptional Can write conditional logic that is succinct and easy to read. Logic can handle all situations where user gives incorrect/unexpected input.

## Functions & Scope

* Proficient  Functions have single responsibility. The entirety of the function is easy to read what functionality it contains. Function is generally shorter than 8 lines. Uses functions to eliminate repeated code. Comfortable refactoring any piece of code and extracting it to a function.

## Arrays

* Proficient  Does not use for loops for arrays - uses array prototypes, such as forEach, to iterate through or manipulate arrays. Can use array to store more complicated data structures such as objects or nested arrays. Is comfortable/efficient with reading array prototype documentation and can efficiently test/apply array prototype methods they have not worked with before.

## Objects & Prototypes

* Proficient  Can use object prototypes. Can articulate the definition and the “why” of an object prototype - the best use cases for prototypes.

## DOM Manipulation

* Proficient  Able to extract information, modify attributes, or append/prepend data in the DOM easily regardless of whether they are employing vanilla JavaScript or jQuery. Understands how to harness event bubbling.

## Style

* Proficient  Code is logically organized, such that reader can easily follow the progression of the app because variable and function names are descriptive and follow a single responsibility approach. There are no major bugs and minimal duplication.


## GIT & GITHUB

## Git

* Proficient  Commits changes frequently with detailed commit messages. Uses feature branches to keep master branch free of incomplete features or bugs.
* Exceptional Knows how to reset to previous commits, rebase large sets of small commits, if applicable, and other advanced Git maneuvers.

## Github

* Proficient  Is comfortable with resolving merge conflicts. Asks for review/merge of their pull requests from teammates. Is comfortable editing code based on review feedback from a pull request and resubmitting the branch code.
* Exceptional Uses issues as resource for project management. There are comments on specific lines of pull requests with discussion about the implementation.


## DESIGN

## Comp Recreation

* Proficient  Developer captures the spirit and design intent of the comp. Some small details need polish to achieve a pixel-perfect match to the comp, but developer is clearly mindful of details and has made a conscious and careful effort to match the comp. Any design decisions left open to interpretation are handled thoughtfully and are well executed, but are more noticeable and/or unintuitive than they would be if the designer had provided the solution, or may not be totally seamless during screen-size transitions.
* Exceptional Developer skillfully captures the spirit and design intent of all comp details. Execution is pixel-perfect and any design decisions left open to interpretation are solved intentionally, are as seamless as if the designer had provided the solution, are handled gracefully, and enhance the overall design.


## PAIRING

## Collaboration

* Exceptional Pair collaboration and communication is exceptional, with the distribution of work being equal and balanced, and both partners experiencing a good working flow, able to handle stress, deadlines, issues with calm and focused demeanor.

## TERMINOLOGY

## Technical Vocab

* Exceptional Can articulate what is going on in the codebase, line by line, using the correct terminology. Developer is confident and comfortable speaking to and answering questions that utilize technical vocabulary.
