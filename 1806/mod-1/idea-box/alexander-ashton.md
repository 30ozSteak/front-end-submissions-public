## Student: Alexander Ela & Ashton Bailey
## Evaluator: Travis Rollins
## Notes/What To Work On:
* Making sure both sides are making commits
* Keep working on making more commits and creating new feature branches
* Add hover states to buttons
* Make sure save button is disabled when inputs are empty
* Great structure of css and easy to ready through
* Keep experimenting with drying up code and using more grouping
* Experiment using pixels/percentages instead of using decimals for ems/rems
* Nice job breaking out global variables, event listeners, and functions
* Be consistent about breaking out functions from event listeners
* Good job using constructor function
* Continue to dry up repeated lines of code including breaking out the appending card functions into one function
* Experiment using array prototype methods over for loops
* Start using jQuery in your next project


## Functional Expectations

* Novice  Application meets all of the basic functional expectations of create, edit, delete, persist in local storage.


## HTML

## Accessibility

* Proficient  Employs detailed accessibility practices throughout markup, especially in forms and can speak to decisions made in accessibility choices as it relates to specific accessibility concerns.

## Style

* Proficient  Crafts lean, efficient markup that is easy to read and follow across naming conventions, structure, and solid formatting that follows industry best practices.


## CSS

## Structure of Code

* Advanced Beginner Can cleanly and logically organize CSS rules according to similar categories (i.e. typography, layout, components), and then logically organize the remaining CSS rules based on flow of the markup. Organizes properties within rules alphabetically.

## Implementation

* Proficient  Develops layouts that work cross-browser, are responsive, and can logically defend the choices made in implementation approach for layout.


## JAVASCRIPT

## Data Types

* Proficient  Can identify and track data types through any variety of functions, understanding their affect and result on each line of code. Knows which scenarios are better suited for objects vs. arrays and employs them accordingly.

## Conditional Logic

* Proficient  Can use an if/esle statement to effectively handle multiple paths through the code. Writes if/else statements that only have one level of logic (no nesting). Can use logical operators instead of if/else statements where applicable.

## Functions & Scope

* Advanced Beginner Developer is comfortable using multiple arguments to pass data into functions. Understands how variables are scoped at the function level and global level. Functions are named descriptively. Knows when and why to use return in a function.

## Arrays

* Advanced Beginner Can modify arrays by adding or removing specific elements - uses array methods such as push or shift. Can use a for loop to iterate through array.

## Objects & Prototypes

* Proficient  Can use object prototypes. Can articulate the definition and the “why” of an object prototype - the best use cases for prototypes.

## DOM Manipulation

* Proficient  Able to extract information, modify attributes, or append/prepend data in the DOM easily regardless of whether they are employing vanilla JavaScript or jQuery. Understands how to harness event bubbling.

## Style

* Proficient  Code is logically organized, such that reader can easily follow the progression of the app because variable and function names are descriptive and follow a single responsibility approach. There are no major bugs and minimal duplication.


## GIT & GITHUB

## Git

* Novice  Can use commits and can articulate what a commit is and why we use them. Makes large, infrequent commits directly to master branch.

## Github

* Advanced Beginner Can execute basic pull requests with context about changes in description. Can keep local and GitHub repositories in sync.


## DESIGN

## Comp Recreation

* Proficient  Developer captures the spirit and design intent of the comp. Some small details need polish to achieve a pixel-perfect match to the comp, but developer is clearly mindful of details and has made a conscious and careful effort to match the comp. Any design decisions left open to interpretation are handled thoughtfully and are well executed, but are more noticeable and/or unintuitive than they would be if the designer had provided the solution, or may not be totally seamless during screen-size transitions.


## PAIRING

## Collaboration

* Proficient  Can diplomatically handle issues that arise between the pair through respectful, focused, targeted feedback and implement changes to positively adapt the working relationship and keep the project on track. Can effectively implement tactics to support their partner’s learning and project goals, while also honoring their own personal learning and project goals, should the two be different or at different levels due to skill delta.

## TERMINOLOGY

## Technical Vocab

* Proficient Can articulate what is going on in the codebase, line by line, using the correct terminology most of the time. Developer can speak to and answer questions that utilize technical vocabulary.
