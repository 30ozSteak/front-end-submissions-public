## Notes/What To Work On:

- nice disabled save button color choices/behavior
- good "completed" button addition
- nice use of transitions when filtering cards
- good github workflow, make sure you're writing clear commit messages, some were a little unclear
- nice use of ARIA
- missing closing HTML tag
- still some unused/unneeded CSS, still could use a clean up refactor pass
- JS is tidy and well factored
- Fantastic use of terminology and really, really good at speaking about your code and the decisions that went into it
- really good team work! So awesome to see a team that worked so well together and enjoyed working together.
- REALLY GOOD JOB!!!!!
