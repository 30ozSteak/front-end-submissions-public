## Notes/What To Work On:

* More atomic commits and branches
* Work on adding aria labels, placeholders, and roles in forms/inputs/buttons
* Remove br in HTML if it's only for styling purposes
* Nice work alphabetizing the properties and structure of your css
* Next step for CSS, cleaning up repeated lines of CSS and grouping them together
* Nice work of using constructor function
* Had one function that was over 8 lines
* Had one anonymous function where it could've been a function declaration
* Experiment using array prototypes next time over a for loop
* Try storing your 2dos as an array in localStorage rather than as separate objects
* Good refactored code in general.  Good use of SRP functions
