## Students: Joel Smith and Laura Shamus
## Evaluator: Travis Rollins
## Notes/What To Work On:

* Keep working on making more commits/branches
* Nice layout and choice of colors on your UI
* Nice work on structure and layout of HTML/CSS
* Good start with adding aria-labels
  - Continue to add more aria-labels/roles to HTML especially in the forms/inputs/buttons
* Nice start on grouping classes that share similar styles
* Still room for more improvement with grouping classes and reusing classes
* Good work using no global variables
* A few functions that are over the 8 line limit (try experimenting using jQuery which can also reduce lines of code)
* Good job on being mostly consistent using function declarations in event listeners
* Experiment storing the data in localStorage as an array rather than as invidial objects
* Experiment going through your qualities with an array rather than checking if the html is set to a specific value
* Good work on keep functions SRP
