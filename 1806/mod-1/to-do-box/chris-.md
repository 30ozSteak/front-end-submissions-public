## Notes/What To Work On:

* Really good, detailed commit messages
* Keep working on making more smaller commit messages and branches
* Design wise, potentially adding more padding to your 2do cards so that buttons and text aren't right up against the edge of each card
* Also UX, potentially move the filtering buttons above the 2do cards so that the user doesn't have to scroll down each time to change the filter.
* Nice use of breakpoints for mobile view
* Good use of aria labels on forms/inputs/buttons and structure of HTML
* Potentially could add a role to the form
* Good work on structure of CSS and using/reusing grouping of classes
* Nice work on not using any global variables
* Good job making functions SRP and keeping them under 8 lines
* Nice working storing your data into localStorage as an array
* Fantastic job on going through qualities with an array and passing values through multiple functions
* With your filter buttons, instead of targeting the class and comparing them to the quality, maybe store the quality in a data attribute/value
