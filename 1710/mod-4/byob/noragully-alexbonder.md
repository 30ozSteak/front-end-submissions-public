    - Yes

* Had at least 10 endpoints that returned responses with appropriate status codes?
    - Yes

* Secured at least 4 endpoints with JWTs?
    - Yes

* Enforced a linter and wrote code that conformed to it?
    - Yes

    - Yes

* Setup automatic deployments with TravisCI to a production app on Heroku?
    - Yes

# Code Quality

#### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub that you are proud of
[happy code example - GitHub link](https://github.com/nogully/denver-history/blob/44920fbf48bee77d31f31ad688a6895ddf813f89/test/routes.spec.js#L708-L723)

* Why were you proud of this piece of code?
    - We were excited to learn about JSON Web tokens and implement them. Also we had some nice 'sad path' handling on this middleware function.

#### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub that you feel not great about
[sad code example - GitHub link](https://github.com/nogully/denver-history/blob/44920fbf48bee77d31f31ad688a6895ddf813f89/test/routes.spec.js#L708-L723)

* Why do you feel not awesome about the code? What challenges did you face trying to write/refactor it?
    - We couldn't figure out how to pass this one error handling test.

#### Attach a screenshot or paste the output from your terminal of the result of your test-suite running.
