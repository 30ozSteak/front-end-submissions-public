# Code Quality

#### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub that you are proud of
[happy code](https://github.com/soytjan/byob/blob/8d144133a677f73fe011afea306e220979df0e7d/db/seeds/dev/families.js#L20-L44)

* Why were you proud of this piece of code?

We were having a really big issue getting the character data to seed with the foreign keys of our wizarding family tree data. For some reason, when we were doing a for each, only the first character was being seeded. After spending a lot time debugging, we eventually tried a for loop and got it to work just fine.

#### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub that you feel not great about
[sad code](https://github.com/soytjan/byob/blob/8d144133a677f73fe011afea306e220979df0e7d/test/routes.spec.js#L228-L250)

* Why do you feel not awesome about the code? What challenges did you face trying to write/refactor it?
The character data is seeding inconsistently. The test is not able to test the count of all of the data being seeding consistently, the count is anywhere between 119 and 125. 

#### Attach a screenshot or paste the output from your terminal of the result of your test-suite running.
