## Completion

#### Were you able to complete the base functionality?

Yes

If not, explain what is missing and why.

#### Which extensions, if any, did you complete?

None. I wanted to add functionality to delete projects and I wanted to work on put at patch calls and to rename Projects and Palettes.

# Code Quality

#### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub that you are proud of
[happy code](https://github.com/lexbonder/palette-picker/blob/master/happy-code)

* Why were you proud of this piece of code?

I think i found a very clever way to refactor the code using a for loop and targeting each slide for different colors.

#### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub that you feel not great about
[sad code](https://github.com/lexbonder/palette-picker/blob/master/sad-code)

* Why do you feel not awesome about the code? What challenges did you face trying to write/refactor it?

I would like to find a way to refactor the creation of these 5 slides the same way I did with the main palette.

#### Attach a screenshot or paste the output from your terminal of the result of your test-suite running.

#### Link to Design Inspiration

* Show us what you used as design inspiration (another color picker site, a dribbble UI element, a user flow, etc.) and explain what you stole from it

All I did was match the comp given to us in the project spec. I'd like to push myself to get better at design. During this project I was balancing demo night and the job search. I'll get more design done on the next projects.

Anything else you wanna say!
