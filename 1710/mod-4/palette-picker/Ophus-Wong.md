# Code Quality

#### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub that you are proud of
[happy code](https://github.com/OphDub/palette-picker/blob/e144b02eab8283844a1a8f202933cec47999e935/public/js/scripts.js#L22-L42)

* Why were you proud of this piece of code?

This is the first time I wrote a closure and I really enjoyed using it

#### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub that you feel not great about
[sad code](https://github.com/OphDub/palette-picker/blob/e144b02eab8283844a1a8f202933cec47999e935/public/js/scripts.js#L109-L135)

* Why do you feel not awesome about the code? What challenges did you face trying to write/refactor it?

This function feels way to big and less modular when compared to some of the other functions in my code. Biggest challenge was trying to figure out how to core out template literal

#### Attach a screenshot or paste the output from your terminal of the result of your test-suite running.

#### Link to Design Inspiration

* Show us what you used as design inspiration (another color picker site, a dribbble UI element, a user flow, etc.) and explain what you stole from it

[Dribble Inspiration](https://dribbble.com/shots/3340684-Color-Palette-Component)

I really wanted something that indicated to the user visually that a color was locked. So when a user clicks on the lock icon in a color box, the lock is closed but it is also moved lower than open locks for another visual cue.
