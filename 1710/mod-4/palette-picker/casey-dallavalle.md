# Code Quality

#### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub that you are proud of
[happy code](https://github.com/cbdallavalle/palette-picker/blob/dc7ebaab0fba13a03e52c970133f5906f5cc0fed/public/js/scripts.js#L67-L71)

This was my first time selecting SVGs and actually going into the document to change the fill color. It took me a little while to figure out how to select the SVG to bring up the actual SVG document (needed to use an option tag). Then traverse into the SVG document to find the specific style tag I wanted to replace. It's not a clever piece of code or anything, but I'm glad I know how to do it!

#### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub that you feel not great about
[sad code](https://github.com/cbdallavalle/palette-picker/blob/dc7ebaab0fba13a03e52c970133f5906f5cc0fed/public/js/scripts.js#L89-L97)

Not the function itself, but I call this function every time I need a rerender, which means the code is accessing the database and reappending every project. I know this is a slow process but I didn't have time to come back to it.

#### Attach a screenshot or paste the output from your terminal of the result of your test-suite running.

I found this picture on pixabay when I was just looking for a background image. I decided to not have a background image and instead try to replicate the picture using SVGs.

#### Please feel free to ask any other questions or make any other statements below!

I really liked this project! I loved working in Node Express and am super excited to keep digging into it. I also suuper appreciated the timeline given to us. That was critical and being able to finish the project.
