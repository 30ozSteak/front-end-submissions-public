## Completion

#### Were you able to complete the base functionality?

If not, explain what is missing and why.
The display of saved projects/palettes and delete. I'm having difficulty balancing work, family, sleep and job search.

#### Which extensions, if any, did you complete?

# Code Quality

#### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub that you are proud of
[happy code](https://github.com/j25bender/palette-picker/blob/master/public/js/scripts.js)

* Why were you proud of this piece of code?
Lines 15 - 28
I thought this was an interesting way to grab the palette from the DOM. Using an incremental for loop value within JSX and block notation. 

#### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub that you feel not great about
[sad code](https://github.com/j25bender/palette-picker/blob/master/public/js/scripts.js)

* Why do you feel not awesome about the code? What challenges did you face trying to write/refactor it?
Lines 30 - 35
There's some code here that looks like it could be refactored to be more DRY.

#### Attach a screenshot or paste the output from your terminal of the result of your test-suite running.

#### Please feel free to ask any other questions or make any other statements below!
