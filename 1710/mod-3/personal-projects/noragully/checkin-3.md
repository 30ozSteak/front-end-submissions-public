## Project Name: 
Twitter Gazette

#### Check In: 3

#### Progress made?
- Firebase is set up
- Oauth is working
- Redux is working
- Using my credentials to grab tweets
- Saving user and tweets in the Redux store 

#### What deliverables still need to be completed from your last checkin?
- API utility that I can test
- POSTing user request to the back end so I pull tweets from any user, not just Nora


#### Next Steps?
- Start testing suite (apiCalls, actions, reducers, MDTP, MSTP)
- Set up a Route to news
- Get tweets on the page


#### What are your concerns (if any)
- Whether I can filter tweets effectively

#### Deliverables for next checkin:
- If you redo the react and redux portion of this project ( getting tweets into the store) 
    - do this without looking so that when you get to the final you'll be okay. 
- Bump up your testing. 
- Set up categories the user can filter off of, once a filter is selected send it to the store (this is totally not needed but it's good practice for redux) 
- Set up the filter API endpoint 
- Have the login button disappear when a user is logged in 
- Styling your app 
- Make some progress on cleaning data so that you can grab specific tweets.
