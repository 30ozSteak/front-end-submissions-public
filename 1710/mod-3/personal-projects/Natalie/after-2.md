Work on getting react-big-calendar clickable

events, user, token, calendarID, village, and time added to the redux store for easy access when fetching to api

#### What deliverables still need to be completed from your last checkin? 

Functionality to delete and edit calendar events from app.

Testing

Work on UI

#### Next Steps?

Functionality to delete/edit events

Test

#### What are your concerns (if any)

The calendar ID is assigned when a calendar is created and in order to allow intereection with the village calendar from app I need a back end to store the calendar ID and users associated with that id. I could also use a backend to store event card boiler info to make the app more interactive. I'm concerned that the scope of the project is too big and may need to be re-evaluated.

#### Deliverables for next checkin:
* TESTING
* Prop Types
* Just focus on having a single user 
* Add functionality to edit and delete events
* Clean up the UI
