#### What deliverables still need to be completed from your last checkin?


#### Next Steps?
* Start accounting for edge cases
* Error handling 
* Finish testing

#### What are your concerns (if any)
* Testing Thunk
* Should I move more API calls into Redux? 
* How do I account for HTML in some of the text blocks I'm getting back?

#### Deliverables for next checkin:

- Move current location to `componentDidMount`
- Move error handling to react  `componentDidCatch` error component 
- Refactor `SearchWelcome` 
  - move logic out of component 
  - have reusable try catch function?
