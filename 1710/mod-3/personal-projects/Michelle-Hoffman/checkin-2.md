## Project Name: Travel Map

#### Check In: 2

#### Progress made?
- A Map component is showing the US
- Test files are started for almost all files
- The browser asks user for permission to use location. Needs to be put in store.
- The controlled form is working to manually submit lat and long. Once submitted, is put in store

#### What deliverables still need to be completed from your last checkin?

#### Next Steps?
- Build add location form and put in store
- Create markers for every location submitted
- Convert lat and long into city/state
- Display miles travelecd

#### What are your concerns (if any)
Testing the google api. I'm not using fetch, so I'm unsure how to do that at this point. 

#### Deliverables for next checkin:

- find a better (faster) way of finding your current location 
  - there might be an endpoint you can hit with google that will determain that for you. 
- Based off of your location maybe move the lat and long out into something that takes in a city 
- Start working on the map overlay 
    - have one state that has an overlay option 
- Work on getting the pins to show up on map. 
- move logic out of the local state into the store.
