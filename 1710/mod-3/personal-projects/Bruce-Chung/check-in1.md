## Project Name: Air Tracker?
#### Check In: 1
#### Project Pitch: Live track aircraft, info on delays and aircraft
### Deliverables
#### Stack: React, Redux, Router, Websockets?
#### APIs: Open-Sky (live pos data), Aviation-Edge (airline and aircraft db), possibly GoogleMaps to plot
#### Wireframes

#### Waffle & Github

#### Order Of Attack
1) get api keys for all possible apis
2) fetch mvp aircraft data
3) build relevant components - info display, search/header
4) display correct information on search
5) fetch googlemaps data
6) plot lat/long on googlemaps and display ac
7) use websockets to update
8) find framework to increase visual appeal
9) add additional information
#### MVP
 - enter in aircraft ID and have it display status, arrival + departure time
#### Nice To Haves
 - show pos live on a map
 - have it constantly update
 - any additional learning info about aircraft
 - fancy visuals - ie view behind a/c, have globe turn underneath
#### Biggest Challenges
 - websockets?
 - updating pos on map
#### Instructor Notes

#### Deliverables for next checkin: steps 1-4

* Be super familiar with API and determine what data you need
* Iron out what info exactly you are going to display
* Set up React, Redux, and Router
* Make an inital fetch reaquest and store info in redux
* Add linter
* Setup test suite
* Add waffle issues
* Build out base landing page
