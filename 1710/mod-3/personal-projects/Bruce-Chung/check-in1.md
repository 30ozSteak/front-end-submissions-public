1) when url entered, fetch from DiffBot to break down to a useable format
2) five potential categories to rate on: author, publisher/org, accuracy, objectivity, currency (publish date)
3) evaluate tools to assessing categories
4) integrate tools into secondary fetch call
5) create rubric for scoring
6) display score and breakdown
7) handle edge cases - 80% should be scored
8) handle load times, improve appearance
9) improve accuracy of rating system
10) integrate with social media platform
