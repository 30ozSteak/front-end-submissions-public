## Project Name: CoffeeBox

#### Check In (what checkin number is this?)
1

#### Project Pitch
The problem: a disorganized and unclear communication system between cafés and the coffee roasters that serve them.

The solution: an authenticated smart form system that creates easier correspondents and a history to trace something

Our app will allow baristas and café managers to track their thoughts on specific batches of coffee, and communicate within their staff and with outside vendors with ease and delight.

### Deliverables

#### Order Of Attack

Iteration 0: Log in, submit a form
Iteration 1: Form sends through email
Iteration 2: Authenticate and store users
Iteration 3: Create user history
Iteration 4: Make it functional and beautiful

#### MVP
Finish Iteration 2

#### Nice To Haves
Backend built in PostgreSQL, not firebase
Multiple, well-documented design iterations

#### Biggest Challenges
Figuring out the SendGrid API
