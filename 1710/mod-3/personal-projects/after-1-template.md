## Project Name:

#### Check In: 1

#### Progress made?
-React, router, redux hooked up and storing values in store
-Initial testing for redux and some components
-independent research into Firebase
-Initialize CSS

#### What deliverables still need to be completed from your last checkin?
-User in store
-API call blocked by CORS error

#### Next Steps?
-Get API to work
-Get user in store
-Get firebase up and running and connect to app

#### What are your concerns (if any)
-After looking more into the board game API, I think it is going to be a bit more challenging to set up the calls than I originally expected. Totally doable and I have a plan, but it's a bit more complicated and it will change my original design layout.

#### Deliverables for next checkin:
- Have firebase working so that you have a user saved in the DB / store 
- Have XML converted to JSON and stored in the store 
- Have the ability for users to add a game to their account.
- Start working on adding multiple users and seeing if they can interact.
