## Project Name:

  - Farmers Market Finder

#### Check In: 
  - Number one

#### Project Pitch

  - I struggle finding a valid organic farmers market or CSA (Community Supported Agriculture). I would like to make an app that takes out the hassle of when and where Farmers markets are at and what products that they have. My app would be able to take a zip code and show you the closest farmers markets to your location. by clicking on the location you like it will show you the details of that farmers market.

### Deliverables

#### Stack:
  - react
  - redux
  - router
  
#### APIs:

  - the US Department of Agriculture, farmers market directory API

#### Wireframes

![wireframe](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29507352/36155094-ac3ece52-1090-11e8-9785-e96361d4f330.jpg)
#### Waffle & Github

  - github: [Farmers Market Finder](https://github.com/goodalls/farmers-market-finder)
  
  - Waffle: [Waffle Farmers Market Finder](https://waffle.io/goodalls/farmers-market-finder)

#### Order Of Attack
  - Wireframe and get color palette set up in project
  - setup redux project
  - build front page with with the components
  - buildin Router and create a goto page when zip-code is submited
  - redux store should hold the search results and individualy clicked locations object
  - 
  
#### MVP

  - Have a front page that accepts zip code search and shows second page with maps and detailed info about the market
  - unregistered user can favorite farmers markets and favorites persist on refresh 
  - When the market is clicked that each farmers market has a "show page" meaning each market page shows information pertaining to it. 
  - Well tested. 
  
#### Nice To Haves
  - latitude and longitude search
  - google maps integration
#### Biggest Challenges

#### Instructor Notes

#### Deliverables for next checkin:
- Have rest of the wireframes built out 
- Have react, redux, router set up 
- make initial fetch call 
- have store populated
- write tests for API utility 
- Have google maps set up so that when you get to landing page you have a map.
