#### What deliverables still need to be completed from your last checkin?
  - implimenting the google map. (i am debating if this is the right approch)

#### Next Steps?
  - build out the page and set up router
  - make another fetch function to get market locations
  - add google maps api to show locations of markets
  - impliment sign in and user information
  - continue tests

#### What are your concerns (if any)
  - Google Maps api is different then I expected. does it allow for me to pass an array to plot points on the map?
  - design is weak...
