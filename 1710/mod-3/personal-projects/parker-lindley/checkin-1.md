## Project Name: TBD Strava Target Segment

#### Check In (what checkin number is this?)
1

#### Project Pitch
 - An App that displays some basic riding stats and gives users the ability unlock 'tokens' based on riding statistics such as milage, elevation, time ridden, power targets and ftp levels. Also a user will be able to 'target' a segment so they can keep track of goals that they want to tackle.

### Deliverables

#### Stack:
  - React
  - Redux
  - Router

#### APIs:
  - Strava
  - Maybe google maps

#### Wireframes
 - [wireframe](https://balsamiq.cloud/s3eav/paq9n)

#### Waffle & Github
- [GitHub](https://github.com/etcetera8/Ride-Tokens)

#### Order Of Attack
- Get all api calls working in api file
- Clean all data in cleaner file
- Create landing page, display data
- Test Landing Page, Cleaner, Api Calls
- Create Stats Page if End up keeping it, may be redundant
- Create Achievments and achievments page,
- Create target segment map, and target segment page and data
- Test all auxillary pages and reducers and actions

#### MVP
- Working Version of App with at minimum achievment tokens as the main goal, and rider stats and map of most recent ride.

#### Nice To Haves
- Map replaced with target segment and target time and own landing page.

#### Biggest Challenges
- Probably creating tokens and showing percentage complete

#### Instructor Notes

* Great jproject idea.... super excited to see the final project

#### Deliverables for next checkin:

* Making API calls/cleaning data
* Base landing page
* Reseach badge libraries
* Setup test suite
* Add linter
* Setup Redux and Router
* Have data going into the store
