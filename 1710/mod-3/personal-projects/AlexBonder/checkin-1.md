## Project Name: Step to the Beat

#### Check In 1

#### Project Pitch

Have you ever caught yourself walking somewhere hearing music, and notice that you've started walking to the rhythm of the song? Step to the Beat takes that concept and flips it! You will be able to calculate your steps per minute either walking or running, and Step to the Beat will supply you with a list of songs that move to the beat of your drum!

#### Order Of Attack

1) Design and build interface
  - Set up redux
2) Set up algorithm to calculate steps per minute
  - Manual test (walk and count)
  - Height and speed
  (- Using Pedometer/Accelerometer)
3) User sign in
4) Save User info
  - Save SPM's by user
  - Save favorite songs
  - Save favorite Playlists
5) Favorite Songs/Lists
6) Persist data
  - Local Storage / (Firebase)
7) Send Lists to Spotify
  

#### MVP

- Create User
- Sign in with Spotify

- Enter/Calculate SPM
- Select Genre
- Recieve playlist

- Get playlist on different speeds
- Save playlist as "My Running List(148bpm)" "My 10 minute/mile playlist" "My casual walk playlist"

- Save favorites from each list
- Save Per Speed playlist
- Push playlist to spotify

#### Nice To Haves

- Accelerometer to count steps
- Running training calendar

#### Biggest Challenges

Spotify API
Oauth

Need backend? - Firebase?
