##### React boilerplate app setup with router, and all of your initial routes
done!

##### Redux wired up
done!

##### Some file for API calls, and at least 2 working calls to Geolocation via app and/or Sendgrid
Decided to move on from Sendgrid because api call neeed to be made from a backend. Going to try to use: https://formspree.io/ instead to send notification emails. Geolocation api is making initial call to get latitude and longitude of user, and making a second call to google geocoding to get street/city/country locations. Data is being cleaned to just city.

##### Focus rest of energy on layout and design of puzzle page
