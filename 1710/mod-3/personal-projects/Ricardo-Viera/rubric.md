### Project Scope

A good project idea should:

* Break down into logical iterations so that you can deliver a strong product on every check-in
* Be something that real people would want to use to solve a problem
* Have enough *technical* challenge to be worth your time (as opposed to a *content* challenge)

### Feature Delivery

**1. Completion**

* 4: Developer completed all the user stories and requirements set in check-ins in timely manner.
* 3: Developer completed all the user stories and requirements set during check-ins.
* 2: Developer completed most of the user stories and requirements set during check-ins.
* 1: Developer completed the user stories and requirements partially.

### CSS/Design

- 4 - Developer has made a targeted effort to make the app appealing and user friendly. Evaluator has minimal recommendations for design changes. Follows [10 Essential Usability Guidelines.](https://speckyboy.com/10-essential-web-application-usability-guidelines/)
- 3 - Developer has made a targeted effort to make the app appealing and user friendly. Evaluator has multiple recommendations for design changes. Follows majority of the [10 Essential Usability Guidelines.](https://speckyboy.com/10-essential-web-application-usability-guidelines/)
- 2 - Developer has made intentional design decisions to create a user friendly application but Louisa would be mad. Attempts to follow [10 Essential Usability Guidelines.](https://speckyboy.com/10-essential-web-application-usability-guidelines/)
- 1 - Developer did minimal to no CSS for this project besides what was indicated in the comp.

### Code Quality

- 4 - Developer demonstrates complete understanding of React with appropriately separated components and exceptionally well refactored code.
- 3 - Developer appears comfortable in React. There are minor opportunities to refactor.
- 2 - Developer selected appropriate libraries and frameworks to build the app but did not use them as intended. Significant refactoring necessary.
- 1 - Developer did not make any effort to use React effectively or refactor code.

### Redux Architecture

* 4: Appropriate components are wrapped in connected Redux container components. The Redux store contains all necessary application data and nothing more. All state changes are handled through Redux actions and reducers. Developer uses middleware. Actions and reducers are clean. At least one container is reused.
* 3: All state changes are handled by Redux with exeception to Controlled Forms. Actions and Reducers are simple. Containers don't hold unnecessary data.
* 2: Application state is mostly outside the control of Redux. Application did not make use of Redux actions and reducers to mutate state. Components do not demonstrate a clear understanding of stateful vs. statelessness.
* 1: Application does not make use of Redux to manage state. There are little or no connected components.

### Code Sanitation

The output from ESLint showsâ€¦

* 4 - Zero complaints
* 3 - Five or fewer complaints
* 2 - Six to ten complaints
* 1 - More than ten complaints

### Testing

- 4 - Every component is tested from both a unit and acceptance standpoint, all crucial functionality is tested
