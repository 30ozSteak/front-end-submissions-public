## Project Name: Read2Me

#### Check In: 1

#### Progress made?

- Standard API called attempted and failed
- set up Node.js express server
- successfully connected server to app with dummy call, resolved OAUTH and cors errors
- clear understanding of payload
- continue to be unable to pass audio flac file into api call (need to pair)
- researched robust, well used and documented mic solution for the DOM (.wav files) https://www.npmjs.com/package/mic
- researched backup solution (sdk for watson) that will take .wav files/.wav streaming https://www.npmjs.com/package/watson-speech
- if this approach taken, can bring in another api for requirements - book metadata/DPLA for sorting through student titles

#### What deliverables still need to be completed from your last checkin?

- API call 
- UI and styling for bookshelf and card
- capture and record audio using the browser
- convert audio to correct file format
- make the api call with the complete payload

#### Next Steps?
I want to give myself one more day to get the audio working. I feel close and am not ready to give up. It's been about 5 days of beating my head against the table, but it feels worth it and I'm confident I can develop out the UI, etc. quickly once this is done.

#### What are your concerns (if any)


#### Deliverables for next checkin:
