## Project Name:
GameBoard

#### Check In: 3

#### Progress made?
Users can sign up/in/out. Users can search for games and add a game to their favorites. Those favorites display on the dashboard and persist after loggin out. Users can add a review to their games as well. Users can search for friends and add them. Then, they can see what games their friends last added or reviewed. 

#### What deliverables still need to be completed from your last checkin?
Other cross user functionality

#### Next Steps?
Bug in the html, bug in the content editable, full testing suite, prop types

#### What are your concerns (if any)
The bug in the html is weird. When I get the game description from the database, there are a bunch of numbers and symbols. I've looked up sanitizing html packages, but none do what I want. I can definitely make one, but I am worried that I could accidentally take out symbols or numbers that are meant to be in the description.

#### Deliverables for next checkin:
Fix bugs, full testing suite, prop types
