#### Order Of Attack
Set up repo with react, react-router and redux
Create components and app structure
Learn Firebase and create a backend for users
Set up user first
Then set up the friends part

#### MVP
What my wireframe have displayed. I would like an application that lets a user sign in and keep track of the board games they have played, as well as, rate them. The next MVP I would like reach for is adding the friends functionality. 

#### Nice To Haves
A discover section where users can explore games by ratings, genre, player numbers, etc.

#### Biggest Challenges
Creating my own backend sounds a little daunting but I am excited to tackle it!
