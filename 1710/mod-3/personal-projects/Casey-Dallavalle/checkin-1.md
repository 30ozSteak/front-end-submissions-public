## Project Name:

#### Check In (what checkin number is this?)
1

#### Project Pitch
A website where you can keep track your games and your friends!

### Deliverables
Backend built
User functionality built out

#### Stack:
React.js, React-Router, Redux, Firebase

[BoardGameGeek](https://boardgamegeek.com/wiki/page/BGG_XML_API&redirectedfrom=XML_API#)
Firebase

#### Order Of Attack
Set up repo with react, react-router and redux
Create components and app structure
Learn Firebase and create a backend for users
Set up user first
Then set up the friends part

#### MVP
What my wireframe have displayed. I would like an application that lets a user sign in and keep track of the board games they have played, as well as, rate them. The next MVP I would like reach for is adding the friends functionality. 

#### Nice To Haves
A discover section where users can explore games by ratings, genre, player numbers, etc.

#### Biggest Challenges
Creating my own backend sounds a little daunting but I am excited to tackle it!
- thankfully firebase will be your backend so you won't have to manage things like oAuth and stuff. 

#### Instructor Notes
- go through the firebase tutorial 

#### Deliverables for next checkin:

- Have react, router, and  redux setup.
- Do a firebase spike where you are looking at the documentation. 
   - look into auth options have what it looks like to have that implemented into your app.
- Make initial api call and have store populated with the data. 
- If a user could create an account in your application.
- Start testing.
