# Instructor Evaluation Points: Game Time
# Instructor: Leta
# Comments:
- Enjoyed theming of game :) Nice UI
- Missing significant portions of testing
- DOM references in Game.js should be moved to index.js

## Functional Expectations

* 4 - Application is fully playable and exceeds the expectations set by instructors

### User Interface

* 4 - The application is pleasant, logical, and easy to use. There are no holes in functionality and the application stands on its own to be used by the instructor _without_ guidance from the developer.

### Testing
// Score is pending (need tests for the Game.js file)
// Without tests for Game.js, score is at a 2
* 4 - Project has a running test suite that exercises the application at multiple levels. The test suite covers almost all aspects of the application and uses mocks and stubs when appropriate.
* 3 - Project has a running test suite that tests multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All functionality is covered by tests. The application makes some use of integration testing.
* 2 - Project has sporadic use of tests at multiple levels. The application contains numerous holes in testing and/or many features are untested.
* 1 - There is little or no evidence of testing in this application.

### JavaScript Style
// Score is pending (refactoring Game.js)
* 4 - Application has exceptionally well-factored code with little or no duplication and all components are separated out into logical components. There are _zero_ instances where an instructor would recommend taking a different approach.
* 3 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

### Workflow

* 4 - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

### Code Sanitation

The output from ESLINT showsâ€¦

* 4 - Zero complaints
