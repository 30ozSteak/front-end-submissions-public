# Instructor Evaluation Points: Game Time
# Instructor: Leta
# Comments:
- Great work refactoring the DOM references out of Game.js!
- Testing suite is very solid

## Functional Expectations

* 4 - Application is fully playable and exceeds the expectations set by instructors
* 3 - Application is fully playable without crashes or bugs

### User Interface

* 3+ - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality.

### Testing
* 4 - Project has a running test suite that exercises the application at multiple levels. The test suite covers almost all aspects of the application and uses mocks and stubs when appropriate.

### JavaScript Style
* 4 - Application has exceptionally well-factored code with little or no duplication and all components are separated out into logical components. There are _zero_ instances where an instructor would recommend taking a different approach.
* 3 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

### Workflow

* 3+ - The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.

### Code Sanitation

The output from eslint showsâ€¦

* 4 - Zero complaints
