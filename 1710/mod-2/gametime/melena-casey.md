- Nice work overall

## Functional Expectations

* 4 - Application is fully playable and exceeds the expectations set by instructors

### User Interface

* 4 - The application is pleasant, logical, and easy to use. There are no holes in functionality and the application stands on its own to be used by the instructor _without_ guidance from the developer.
* 3 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality.

### Testing

* 4 - Project has a running test suite that exercises the application at multiple levels. The test suite covers almost all aspects of the application and uses mocks and stubs when appropriate.

### JavaScript Style

* 3 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

### Workflow

* 4 - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

### Code Sanitation

The output from JSHint showsâ€¦

* 4 - Zero complaints
