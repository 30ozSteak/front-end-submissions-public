# Instructor Evaluation Points: Game Time
# Instructor: Leta
# Comments:
- Original inheritance was shaky; nice job refactoring!
- Logic living in odd places (Frogger controlling game score, etc)
- A few areas where code could be DRYd up by leveraging parameters
- Nice work overall

## Functional Expectations

* 3 - Application is fully playable without crashes or bugs

### User Interface

3+

* 4 - The application is pleasant, logical, and easy to use. There are no holes in functionality and the application stands on its own to be used by the instructor _without_ guidance from the developer.
* 3 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality.

### Testing

3+

* 4 - Project has a running test suite that exercises the application at multiple levels. The test suite covers almost all aspects of the application and uses mocks and stubs when appropriate.
* 3 - Project has a running test suite that tests multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All functionality is covered by tests. The application makes some use of integration testing.

### JavaScript Style

* 3 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.


### Workflow

// Fear not the merge conflict!

* 4 - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

### Code Sanitation

The output from JSHint showsâ€¦

* 4 - Zero complaints
