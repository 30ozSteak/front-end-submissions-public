# Instructor Evaluation Points: Game Time
# Instructor: Leta
# Comments:
- Remove DOM references from Game.js
- Understanding of how to leverage parameters is still shaky
    - example: if you only want to use the canvas width, avoid passing in the whole canvas

## Functional Expectations

* 3 - Application is fully playable without crashes or bugs

### User Interface

* 4 - The application is pleasant, logical, and easy to use. There are no holes in functionality and the application stands on its own to be used by the instructor _without_ guidance from the developer.

### Testing

* 3 - Project has a running test suite that tests multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All functionality is covered by tests. The application makes some use of integration testing.

### JavaScript Style
// Score is pending refactor to remove instances of the dom (document, canvas, etc) from Game and into index.js
* 3 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.
* 2 - Your application has a significant amount of duplication and one or more major bugs.

### Workflow

* 3 - The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.

### Code Sanitation

The output from JSHint showsâ€¦

* 4 - Zero complaints
