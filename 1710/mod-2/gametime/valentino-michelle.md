## Functional Expectations

* 3 - Application is fully playable without crashes or bugs

### User Interface

* 3.5 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality.

### Testing
// paddle/border collision with paddle.move function
// brick/ball collision changes ball dx/dy
// ball/paddle collision changes ball dx/dy

score: just barely a 3 - tests are still very weak/not semantic

* 3 - Project has a running test suite that tests multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All functionality is covered by tests. The application makes some use of integration testing.
* 2 - Project has sporadic use of tests at multiple levels. The application contains numerous holes in testing and/or many features are untested.

### JavaScript Style

score: JUST a 3

* 3 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.
* 2 - Your application has a significant amount of duplication and one or more major bugs.

### Workflow

* 4 - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

### Code Sanitation
// npm install jquery
The output from JSHint showsâ€¦

* 4 - Zero complaints
