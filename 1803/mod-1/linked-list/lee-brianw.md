## Notes/What To Work On:

- Be sure to get your final PR merged before it's due - would have loved to see the final product! (Functionality is missing `unread links` tracking and url validation from this version)
- Great job with accessibility!
- Keep pushing forward with refactoring in JS and organization in CSS
