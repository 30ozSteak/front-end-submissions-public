## Student: Kent & Dave
## Evaluator: Pamela Lovett
## Notes/What To Work On:

- Nice job getting through parts of Phase III! Some bugs and incomplete from earlier phases. 
- Continue to push forward with accessibility (forms, labels), CSS organization (SMACSS for rules and idiomatic or alphabetic for declaration), more commits (be descriptive but concise), and SRP/naming in JS.
- Work on formatting across all files - reference style sheets for [HTML](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/html), [CSS](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/css), [JS](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/javascript/tree/master/es5)
