## Student: Gavin - Kent
## Evaluator: Nathaniel
## Notes/What To Work On:

## Functional Expectations
functional, no extensions
* Proficient  The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by jQuery. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals.

## HTML

## Accessibility
Add aria-label to input tags
* Advanced Beginner Leverages more precise semantic tags when applicable, and employs basic ARIA roles attributes for added clarity in structure, descriptive image alt attributes, title attributes for applicable anchor tags.

## Style
use fewer elements if possible
double check indentation
* Advanced Beginner Crafts markup with proper and logical nesting.

## CSS

## Structure of Code

* Proficient  Leverages cascading styles and CSS specificity rules to create more complex targeting of elements in order to reduce, reuse, share styles across elements. Organizes properties within rules based upon industry standard principles of writing consistent, idiomatic CSS.

## Implementation
Try to use fewer px, more em or rem
* Proficient  Develops layouts that work cross-browser, are responsive, and can logically defend the choices made in implementation approach for layout.


## JAVASCRIPT

## Data Types

* Proficient  Can identify and track data types through any variety of functions, understanding their affect and result on each line of code. Knows which scenarios are better suited for objects vs. arrays and employs them accordingly.

## Conditional Logic
Some areas for refactoring
* Proficient  Can use an if/esle statement to effectively handle multiple paths through the code. Writes if/else statements that only have one level of logic (no nesting). Can use logical operators instead of if/else statements where applicable.

## Functions & Scope
Try to refactor editBody and editTitle so there is less repeated code
* Proficient  Functions have single responsibility. The entirety of the function is easy to read what functionality it contains. Function is generally shorter than 8 lines. Uses functions to eliminate repeated code. Comfortable refactoring any piece of code and extracting it to a function.

## Arrays
Try to use forEach vs for loops
* Advanced Beginner Can modify arrays by adding or removing specific elements - uses array methods such as push or shift. Can use a for loop to iterate through array.

## Objects & Prototypes
Try to use a prototype function to generate the html for an idea
* Advanced Beginner Can use object constructor functions and is comfortable with extracting values of properties on different object instances.

## DOM Manipulation

* Proficient  Able to extract information, modify attributes, or append/prepend data in the DOM easily regardless of whether they are employing vanilla JavaScript or jQuery. Understands how to harness event bubbling.

## Style

* Proficient  Code is logically organized, such that reader can easily follow the progression of the app because variable and function names are descriptive and follow a single responsibility approach. There are no major bugs and minimal duplication.

## GIT & GITHUB

## Git
// fix git issues
* Novice  Can use commits and can articulate what a commit is and why we use them. Makes large, infrequent commits directly to master branch.

## Github

* Proficient  Is comfortable with resolving merge conflicts. Asks for review/merge of their pull requests from teammates. Is comfortable editing code based on review feedback from a pull request and resubmitting the branch code.


## DESIGN

## Comp Recreation

* Proficient  Developer captures the spirit and design intent of the comp. Some small details need polish to achieve a pixel-perfect match to the comp, but developer is clearly mindful of details and has made a conscious and careful effort to match the comp. Any design decisions left open to interpretation are handled thoughtfully and are well executed, but are more noticeable and/or unintuitive than they would be if the designer had provided the solution, or may not be totally seamless during screen-size transitions.


## PAIRING

## Collaboration

* Advanced Beginner Can identify deltas in skill level and collaborate on methods whereby both pairs can share equitably in the workload. Can revisit the DTR to address changes that arise, and/or simply to keep one another reminded of the working plan.

## TERMINOLOGY

## Technical Vocab

* Proficient Can articulate what is going on in the codebase, line by line, using the correct terminology most of the time. Developer can speak to and answer questions that utilize technical vocabulary.
