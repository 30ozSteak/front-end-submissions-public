## Notes/What To Work On:

## Functional Expectations
can’t hit enter on input fields 
quality persists, but can’t change after 
button disabled initially but not after input change
no search

* Novice  Application meets all of the basic functional expectations of create, edit, delete, persist in local storage.


## HTML

## Accessibility
Put your inputs and button in a form element
* Advanced Beginner Leverages more precise semantic tags when applicable, and employs basic ARIA roles attributes for added clarity in structure, descriptive image alt attributes, title attributes for applicable anchor tags.

## Style
Work on indentation
* Advanced Beginner Crafts markup with proper and logical nesting.

## CSS

## Structure of Code
Use at least two spaces for indentation
* Novice  Can effectively target DOM elements via tag, class, and/or id and write CSS rules around each element to create the desired style.

## Implementation
try not to use so many position modifiers margin-left/margin-right, to get exact position, use block elements, margin: auto…
* Novice  Can articulate how the CSS box model works and apply it appropriately in a static layout.

## JAVASCRIPT

## Data Types
* Advanced Beginner Can diagnose when issues of data-type mismatch are present and appropriately redirect their coding and/or research efforts accordingly to solve the problem.

## Conditional Logic

* Proficient  Can use an if/esle statement to effectively handle multiple paths through the code. Writes if/else statements that only have one level of logic (no nesting). Can use logical operators instead of if/else statements where applicable.

## Functions & Scope
make sure to use var even with jquery

* Advanced Beginner Developer is comfortable using multiple arguments to pass data into functions. Understands how variables are scoped at the function level and global level. Functions are named descriptively. Knows when and why to use return in a function.

## Arrays
Try to use array iterator prototype functions like forEach to loop over array
* Advanced Beginner Can modify arrays by adding or removing specific elements - uses array methods such as push or shift. Can use a for loop to iterate through array.

## Objects & Prototypes
Try to use an prototype function to generate your card's html
e.g. Card.prototype.createHTML
* Advanced Beginner Can use object constructor functions and is comfortable with extracting values of properties on different object instances.

## DOM Manipulation

* Proficient  Able to extract information, modify attributes, or append/prepend data in the DOM easily regardless of whether they are employing vanilla JavaScript or jQuery. Understands how to harness event bubbling.

## Style
Fix indentation
* Novice  Can explain the choices made in the overall codebase and is able to articulate what every line of code is doing. Code is neatly formatted and easy to read with correct indentation.

## GIT & GITHUB

## Git
Make smaller commits with more detailed messages
* Advanced Beginner Can create branches and willingly attempts to incorporate branches into their workflow. Commits, while infrequent, are increased in volume and show improvements in description.

## Github

* Advanced Beginner Can execute basic pull requests with context about changes in description. Can keep local and GitHub repositories in sync.

## DESIGN

## Comp Recreation

* Advanced Beginner Can accomplish about 50-75% of the large and small design details and can logically rework them on at least 1 breakpoint.


## PAIRING

## Collaboration

* Proficient  Can diplomatically handle issues that arise between the pair through respectful, focused, targeted feedback and implement changes to positively adapt the working relationship and keep the project on track. Can effectively implement tactics to support their partner’s learning and project goals, while also honoring their own personal learning and project goals, should the two be different or at different levels due to skill delta.

## TERMINOLOGY

## Technical Vocab

* Proficient Can articulate what is going on in the codebase, line by line, using the correct terminology most of the time. Developer can speak to and answer questions that utilize technical vocabulary.
