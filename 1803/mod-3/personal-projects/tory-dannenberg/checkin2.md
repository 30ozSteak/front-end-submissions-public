## Project Name: BBQ-Tracker

#### Check In: 2

#### Progress made?
Built a backend using Node Express that allows users to sign in and retrieves restaurants they have visited. 
Setup initial front-end file structure, testing and linter, wrote fetch call for yelp api and added a search field that allows you to make fetch calls based on different locations. Restaurants coming back from fetch call are saved to the store and displayed to the dom.  There is a login form where a user can login, which makes a fetch call to my BE database and saves the users name, id and visited restaurants to the store. 

#### What deliverables still need to be completed from your last checkin?
None

#### Next Steps?
Build out sign in form, start working on functionality to be able to save visited restaurants and add them to the database. CSS it up!!

#### What are your concerns (if any)
My back-end. The sign-in fetch call requires the username and password in the url instead of a body object.

#### Deliverables for next checkin:
