#Check In (what checkin number is this?) Initial checkin 1

#Project Pitch
Sports betting apps are often confusing, full of ads, and incredibly annoying. This app will make it possible to maintain a bet over the course of an entire season. It is designed to be a betting app for friends, with no daily pools, fantasy leagues, or confusing scoring systems. One can simply create a league, invite friends, pick teams and sit back. Users will have the ability to track their teams progress throughout the course of the season.

#Order Of Attack 
Iteration 0: Build back end Iteration 1: Create login system Iteration 2: pull/clean/display data from the sportsRadar API Iteration 3: REACT it (with TDD).

#MVP 
An app that displays sports data and lets one user create a league and pick teams for everyone in the league
Nice To Haves Live draft feature using web sockets
Biggest Challenges Building a backend and getting web sockets to work as I hope.
