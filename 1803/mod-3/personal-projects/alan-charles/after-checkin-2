# Project Pitch:
Sports betting apps are often confusing, full of ads, and incredibly annoying. This app will make it possible to maintain a bet over the course of an entire season. It is designed to be a betting app for friends, with no daily pools, fantasy leagues, or confusing scoring systems. One can simply create a league, invite friends, pick teams and sit back. Users will have the ability to track their teams progress throughout the course of the season.
