Project Name: Love-15

Check In: final

Progress made: 

Project is almost completely styled.

Now has firebase backend that authenticates and stores users, persists login on page refresh, retrieves all users for user to see and lets user add favorite courts to a list in the database.

What deliverables still need to be completed from your last checkin: none

Next Steps:

Need to allow users to remove favorites and view favorites
Need to style user list
Need to test new actions and firebase methods

What are your concerns (if any) Deliverables for next checkin:

testing firebase methods is my main concern.

# Deliverables for next checkin

- [ ] Background image should have an opacity screen in front of it
- [ ] 'Other users' should have cards that are not full width
- [ ] Add favorites route
- [ ] Make court card clickable
- [ ] Move back button on court route into card
