Project Name: Love-15; Check In: 1

Progress made? User can search for courts, User can create account or log in, user can go to separate create account page. Current components are tested.
What deliverables still need to be completed from your last checkin? None.
Next Steps? Implement log in and createAccount message. Start adding styling. I may implement local storage to save account info.
What are your concerns (if any): Finding a good design. Building a back end(if I get there).
Deliverables for next checkin: [] Separate routes for login and search [] Style both forms [] Add UI for each of the courts [] Each court should link to its own component, address should link to a map [] Implement firebase authentication for login
