Project Name: colorado-fire

Check In: 1

Progress made?: 
I have made my initial fetch to both of my apis, my react redux boilerplate is set-up, I have intiial setup of google maps and I have put mor e though into how I want to use my data.

What deliverables still need to be completed from your last checkin?:
I have pivoted since the last checkin and I am not going tpo be working on fire bans, so that deliverable is not relevant anymore.  Other than that, I feel like I am making good progress.

Next Steps?:
1. Clean and combine data.
2. get markers on the map.
3. get information on that map on click of fire location.
4. continue researching node.js and express.
5. Look into microservices (Amazon Lambda)

What are your concerns (if any):
No concerns.  Still have a lot to learn about google maps. Has been sort of confusing so far.

Deliverables for next checkin:
