Project Name: colorado-fire

Check In: 4

Progress made?:

What deliverables still need to be completed from your last checkin?:
1. testing
2. backend/ pins on map.

Next Steps?:

1. Fires should link to more information, or display more info
2. Finish writing tests for all existing code adn for each as I write going forward.
3. continue researching node.js and express.
4. Add pins for 'reported fires'
5. Look into microservices (Amazon Lambda).
6. Build out search functionality?

What are your concerns (if any):
I am needing to make decisions about what is priority.
