## Project Name: soccer-scores

#### Check In 1

#### Project Pitch:

Soccer-Scores will be a live scores application. There are a lot of similar apps out there, but I have found them to be lacking in certain areas. What I aim to build, is an app where one can not only check live scores and league standings, but also allow the user to click on individual players and check out they're profile. This is often where my interest lies. Who is the player that just scored? Are they a young up-and-comer, or just an old player I haven't heard of? Which clubs have they played for? where are they from? All of those questions should be answered when my app is complete.

### Deliverables:

My plan is to approach this project in steps. First making the layout and then working myself through the API data. I will start with first displaying scores and league standings, before I dive into making fetch calls for individual players. 

#### Stack:

React, Redux, Router, Thunk

#### APIs:

parsing the data from the APIs

#### Instructor Notes

#### Deliverables for next checkin:
 * Make sure that you can access the data you need from the api
 * Setup file structure, connect redux and router
 * Start building out the UI
 * Making initial fetch and put data into the store
 * Start testing
 * Linter
 * Keep github issues current
