## Project Name:
Cheese Plate

#### Check In (what checkin number is this?)
1

#### Project Pitch
An app that allows you to put together cheese combinations from a large database of cheese options to get you to pair new things.  Provides guidelines on how to put together a plate and allows you to save combinations and favorites.

If the wine API comes through, I will potentially be able to offer a pairing of wine with a cheese with information on where to buy them and then will avoid having a backend

### Deliverables


#### Stack:
* React
* Redux
* React-Router
* Middleware?
* Node/firebase for backend


#### APIs:
* curdCollective
* potentially a wine api to pair...still waiting on the wine api

#### Wireframes


#### Waffle & Github
Will use github to track issues

#### Order Of Attack
* API calls (testing)
* user login ? (testing)
* rendering (testing)
* styling
* user testing


#### MVP
An app where users can research and save favorite cheeses


#### Nice To Haves
a back-end for repeat user

#### Biggest Challenges
I think time will be a big challenge for me.  I am not the fastest coder, nor do I have the fastest logic brain.  If there is a backend, I will most certainly have some challenges with that having never used one before.  But I have several people I can reach out to.
