## Project Name:

#### Check In: 2

#### Progress made? 

Set up redux/react, set up basic structure, learned more about building backends

#### What deliverables still need to be completed from your last checkin? 

Api call needs to be made and set to state

#### Next Steps?

Solve github issue, fix api call for setlist, create backend repo

#### What are your concerns (if any)

Not enough time if I need to build backends into both api requests

#### Deliverables for next checkin:

[] Find an API that can pull setlists into the browser
[] Get those shows (or similar) appearing on the page
[] Spend some time working on the UI
