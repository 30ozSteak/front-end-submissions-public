## Project Name:
qwwickbiit

#### Check In: 1

#### Progress made?
I have the yelp data that I need, Google map api is working and rendering a map with markers. Layout decisions have been made. I have built out a backend to store users, I just need to implement it into my app.

#### What deliverables still need to be completed from your last checkin?
I think everything is complete from last check-in.

#### Next Steps?
Routing for each component, fix fetch calls on page load so that you don't have to click submit to fetch restaurants. Start testing.

#### What are your concerns (if any)
Do I need to break anything out of map in terms of testing? I will not be testing anything npm related. How will I deal with load times and rendering in order to make a fluid experience. How will I filter and will a new fetch call be made when a fitler is selected.

#### Deliverables for next checkin:
