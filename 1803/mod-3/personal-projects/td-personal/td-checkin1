## Project Name: BBQ Tracker

#### Check In 1

#### Project Pitch
BBQ tracking app. The app will be able to find local barbecue via the yelp api. The user will be able to filter by style, save restaurants to try later, and keep track of barbecue that they have tried. At some point I would like to incorporate google maps and suggest bbq for upcoming roadtrips. 

### Deliverables

#### Stack:
React, Router, Redux

#### APIs:
Yelp

#### Wireframes
![HomePage]( "bbq tracker home")
![ResultsPage]( "bbq tracker results page")


#### Waffle & Github
Github issues

#### Order Of Attack
* Set up initial file structure
* Get Fetch call and data cleaner working
* Search by location and display top 10/20 bbq restaurants in the area by rating
* Filter BBQ by style (Carolina, Memphis, Texas, etc..)
* Mark BBQ restaurants as have tried or want to try
* Buttons to route user to list of restaurants that they have tried or want to try
* Reviewing system for have tried restaurants
* Back-end that allows users to sign in and save their BBQ eating history
* Interactive map of US that has pins for restaurants to try/have tried

#### MVP
User can search for bbq in their area, filter by style and save restaurants that they have tried or want to try


#### Nice To Haves

#### Biggest Challenges
