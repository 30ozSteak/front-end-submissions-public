Pitch:
My app is called Love-15. It is an app for finding people to play tennis at well as finding coaches. It functions similiarly to ideabox where every person is on a card. You can enter whether you're looking for singles or doubles play and what skill level you're looking for. It also displays tennis courts in the area.

stack: React, Redux, Router, Node.js, Postgres.

Api: google places

Github and waffle: 
gh: https://github.com/airum82/love-15

Order of Attack: 
iteration0: basic ccs styling. User should be able to create an account. Account should be stored in backend.
iteration1: user should be able to see other users. Should indicate whether they are players, coaches or both.
iteration2: user should be able to select their own skill level and skill level they are looking for as well as if they want to play doubles, singles or both.
iteration3: data should be pulled from google places api to display tennis courts in the area. User should be able to add and save friends.

MVP: Being able to search based on skill level.
