## Project Name: Retirement Planner

#### Check In: 2

#### Progress made?
setup file structure, redux, router. I will need to add in a few more components for displaying and managing user info visually.

linter is all setup and everything is nice and clean.

getting a user into the store, I have user info being place into the store. Just user info is setup no user identiy just yet.

fetch data from news api and put data into the store - this is all working.

start testing, only a few simple unit test are going.

The UI is a littl rough right now but the information needed is starting to come together and accessable where it is need to be displayed.

store structure is very flat and I plan to keep it that way.

#### What deliverables still need to be completed from your last checkin?

more testing.

#### Next Steps?

I need to finish creating the income and expense forms and having that data put into the store.

Info in store needs to be visually available in the UI

More tests
