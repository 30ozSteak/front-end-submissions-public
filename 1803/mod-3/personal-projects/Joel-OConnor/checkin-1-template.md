## Project Name: Retirement Planner

#### Check In (what checkin number is this?) 1

#### Project Pitch: 
  
  I'm making a program that solves the problem of helping people plan for their retirement. During my career in finance I found that there was a lack of quality retirement planing software available for free. I plan to create a product that will have a smooth and comfortable user experience while going over the complexities of planing a persons financial future.

### Deliverables: The completed calculator and UI project

#### Stack: React, Redux, Router, Enzyme, CSS

#### APIs: https://newsapi.org/docs/get-started 

#### Wireframes: <img src"Retirement-Planner.sketch">

#### Waffle & Github: https://github.com/JoOCon/retirement-planner

#### Order Of Attack: 

  create user homepage
  integrate API news feed
  create calculator
  create visual display of financial info page
  integrate graphical display and custom user inputs for financial data. 

#### MVP

  create user homepage - user can see news from API and alter the news feed based on the input-field. Signup/login will be presented here. Optional button to use product without user info.

  create calculator - income and expense pages will both allow user input of financial information which will add up to provide net income. There will be a list of common income sources and expenses you can also select for auto-fill.

  create visual display of financial info - final page will take user financial info and simulate a potential retirement plan using default parameters ie. life expectancy, %of net income put in savings monthly, projected retirement age, desired retirement stipend per month. All parameters will be manually adjustable by user. 

#### Nice To Haves:

  back-end for user login
  api that sources statistical data on retirement

#### Biggest Challenges

  Setting up data flow with redux and managing calculations correctly. Testing...

#### Instructor Notes

* Good job nailing down all the details of this project.
* Good luck with all the math
* Excited to see you incorporate a cool graph

#### Deliverables for next checkin:
* setup all file structure, redux, router
* linter
* getting a user into the store
* fetch data from news api and put data into the store
* start testing 
* start building out the UI
* keep your github issues current
* store structure - don't duplicate and keep data flat
